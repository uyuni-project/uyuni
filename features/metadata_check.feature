Feature: Test SUSE Manager generated metadata
  In Order to validate the SUSE Manager generated metadata
  As an local user
  I want to see several xml elements and attributes in the metadata

  Scenario: Check pre requires
    Given I am root
    When I refresh the metadata
    Then I should have 'pre="1"' in the metadata

  Scenario: Check for empty epoch
    Given I am root
    When I refresh the metadata
    Then I should not have 'epoch="0"' in the metadata
