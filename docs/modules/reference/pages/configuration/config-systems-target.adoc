= Target Systems

This page shows the systems that are not prepared for configuration file deployment, or are not yet subscribed to a configuration channel.

The table has three columns:

* The system name
* If the system is prepared for configuration file deployment
* The steps necessary to prepare the system.

To prepare a system, check the box to the left of the profile name then click the btn:[Enable SUSE Manager Configuration Management] button.
All of the preparatory steps that can be automatically performed are scheduled by {productname}.

[NOTE]
====
You will need to perform some manual tasks to enable configuration file deployment.
Follow the on-screen instructions provided to assist with each step.
