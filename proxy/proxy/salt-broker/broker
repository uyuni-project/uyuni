######      Keepalive settings        ######
############################################
# ZeroMQ includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by
# the OS. If connections between the broker and the master pass through
# a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is
# the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion
# without informing either party that their connection has been taken away.
# Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening.

# Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False)
# or leave to the OS defaults (\-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled.
#tcp_keepalive: True

# How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300
# to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (\-1) is typically 7200 seconds
# on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time.
#tcp_keepalive_idle: 300

# How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default \-1
# to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes.
#tcp_keepalive_cnt: \-1

# How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default \-1 to
# use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see
# /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl.
#tcp_keepalive_intvl: \-1

# Logs can be sent either to standard output/error or to file
# default: 1 to send logs to file
# 0 to send logs to standard output/error
log_to_file: 1

######   ZeroMQ connection options    ######
############################################
# For more details about the following parameters check ZeroMQ documentation:
# http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-setsockopt
# All of these parameters will be set to the backend sockets
# (from the salt-broker to the salt-master)

# connect_timeout (sets ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets how long to wait before timing-out a connect to the remote socket.
# 0 could take much time, so it could be better to set to more strict value
# for particular environment depending on the network conditions.
# The value equal to 10000 is setting 10 seconds connect timeout.
connect_timeout: 0

# reconnect_ivl (sets ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL)
# default: 100
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets the interval of time before reconnection attempt on connection drop.
reconnect_ivl: 100

# heartbeat_ivl (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# This parameter is important for detection of loosing the connection.
# In case of value equal to 0 it is not sending heartbits.
# It's better to set to more relevant value for the particular environment,
# depending on possible network issues.
# The value equal to 20000 (20 seconds) works good for most cases.
heartbeat_ivl: 0

# heartbeat_timeout (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets the interval of time to consider that the connection is timed out
# after sending the heartbeat and not getting the response on it.
# The value equal to 60000 (1 minute) is considering the connection is down
# after 1 minute of no response to the heartbeat.
heartbeat_timeout: 0


######   Other connection options    ######
# The following parameters are not related to ZeroMQ,
# but the internal parameters of the salt-broker.
# drop_after_retries
# default: -1
# value unit: number of retries
# Drop the frontend sockets of the salt-broker in case if it reaches
# the number of retries to reconnect to the backend socket.
# -1 means not drop the frontend sockets
# It's better to choose more relevant value for the particular environment.
# 10 can be a good choise for most of the cases.
drop_after_retries: -1

# wait_for_backend
# default: False
# The main aim of this parameter is to prevent  collecting the messages
# with the open frontend socket and prevent pushing them on connecting
# the backend socket to prevent large number of messages to be pushed
# at once to salt-master.
# It's better to set it to True if there is significant numer of minions
# behind the salt-broker.
wait_for_backend: False
