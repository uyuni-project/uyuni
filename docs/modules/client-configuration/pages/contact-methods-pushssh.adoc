= Push via SSH


Push via SSH is used in environments where traditional clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

The Push via SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the {productname} Server on the internal network to the clients located on the DMZ.
After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed.

The server uses SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events.

This contact method works for traditional clients only.
For Salt clients, use Push via Salt SSH.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with push via SSH.

All items left of the [systemitem]``Taskomatic`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

For tunneling connections via SSH, two available port numbers are required, one for tunneling HTTP and the second for tunneling via HTTPS (HTTP is only necessary during the registration process).
The port numbers used by default are `1232` and `1233`.
To overwrite these, you can add two custom port numbers greater than 1024 to [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
ssh_push_port_http = high_port_1
ssh_push_port_https = high_port_2
----


If you would like your clients to be contacted using their hostnames instead of an IP address, set this option:

----
ssh_push_use_hostname = true
----


It is also possible to adjust the number of threads to use for opening client connections in parallel.
By default two parallel threads are used.
Set [systemitem]``taskomatic.ssh_push_workers`` in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
taskomatic.ssh_push_workers = number
----


For security reasons, you might want to use sudo with SSH, to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root.


.Procedure: Configuring Unprivileged SSH Access
. Ensure you have the latest [path]``spacewalk-taskomatic`` and [path]``spacewalk-certs-tools`` packages installed on the {productname} Server.
. On each client system, create an appropriate unprivileged user.
. On each client system, open the [path]``/etc/sudoers`` file and comment out these lines:
+
----
#Defaults targetpw   # ask for the password of the target user i.e. root
#ALL    ALL=(ALL) ALL   # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!
----
. On each client system, in the `User privilege specification` section, add these lines:
+
----
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/mgr_check
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/<user>/enable.sh
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/<user>/bootstrap.sh
----
. On each client system, in the [path]``/home/user/.bashrc`` file, add these lines:
+
----
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
export PATH
----
. On the {productname} Server, in the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, add or amend this line to include the unprivileged username:
+
----
ssh_push_sudo_user = <user>
----


Because clients are in the DMZ and cannot reach the server, you need to use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool to register them with the {productname} Server.

To use the tool, you will need the client hostname or IP address, and the path to a valid bootstrap script on the {productname} Server.
For more information about bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

The bootstrap script will need to have an activation key associated with it that is configured for Push via SSH.
For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].

Before you begin, you need to ensure that you have specified which ports to use for SSH tunneling.
If you have registered clients before changing the port numbers, they will need to be registered again.

[NOTE]
====
Clients that are managed with Push via SSH cannot reach the server directly.
When you use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool, the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` daemon is disabled.
====


.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via SSH
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, execute this command:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> --register \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
+
OPTIONAL: You can remove the [command]``--tunnel`` option, if you do not want to use tunneling.
. Verify that the SSH connection is active:
+
----
# ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_susemanager -R <high_port>:<susemanager>:443 \
<client> zypper ref
----



.Example: API Access to Push via SSH

You can use the API to manage which contact method to use.
This example Python code sets the contact method to ``ssh-push``.

Valid values are:

* `default` (pull)
* `ssh-push`
* `ssh-push-tunnel`

----
client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + "/rpc/api", verbose=0)
key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD)
client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'})
----



If you have a client that has already been registered, and you want to migrate it to use Push via SSH, some extra steps are required.
You can use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool to set up your client.


.Procedure: Migrating Registered Systems to Push via SSH
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, set up the client:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
. Using the {productname} {webui}, change the client's contact method to `ssh-push` or `ssh-push-tunnel`.
. OPTIONAL: If you need to edit an existing activation key, you can do so with this command:
+
----
client.activationkey.setDetails(key, '1-mykey', {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'})
----



You can also use Push via SSH for clients that connect using a {productname} Proxy.
Ensure your proxy is updated before you begin.

.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via SSH to a Proxy
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Proxy, as root, set up the client:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, copy the SSH key to the proxy:
+
----
mgr-ssh-push-init --client <proxy>
----
