. Enter a label for the patch in the [guimenu]``Advisory`` field, ideally following a naming convention adopted by your organization.
+
ifdef::showremarks[]
#emap: Similar patch beginnings for SUSE? "Note that this label cannot begin with the letters "RH" (capitalized or not) to prevent confusion between custom errata and those issued by Red Hat."#
endif::showremarks[]
. Complete all remaining required fields, then click the btn:[Create Patch] button. View standard SUSE Alerts for examples of properly completed fields.

Patch management distinguishes between published and unpublished patches.

* [guimenu]``Published`` : this page displays the patch alerts the organization has created and disseminated. To edit an existing published patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-assign-packs>>. To distribute the patch, click btn:[Send Notification] in the [guimenu]``Send Patch Mail`` section on the top of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page. The patch alert is sent to the administrators of all affected systems.
* [guimenu]``Unublished`` : this page displays the patch alerts your organization has created but not yet distributed. To edit an existing unpublished patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-assign-packs>>. To publish the patch, click btn:[Publish Patch] on the top-right corner of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page. Confirm the channels associated with the patch and click the btn:[Publish Patch] button, now in the lower-right corner. The patch alert is moved to the [guimenu]``Published`` page awaiting distribution.

{productname} administrators can also create patches by cloning an existing one.
Cloning preserves package associations and simplifies issuing patches.
See xref:reference:patches/clone-patches.adoc[Clone Patches] for instructions.

To edit an existing patch alert's details, click its advisory on the [guimenu]``Patches Management`` page, make the changes in the appropriate fields of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and click the btn:[Update Patch] button.
Click the [guimenu]``Channels`` tab to alter the patch's channel association.
Click the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab to view and modify its packages.

To delete patches, select their check boxes on the [guimenu]``Patches Management`` page, click the btn:[Delete Patches] button, and confirm the action.
Deleting published patches might take a few minutes.

== Assigning Packages to Patches

To assign packages to patches, proceed as follows:

. Select a patch, click the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab, then the [guimenu]``Add`` subtab.
. To associate packages with the patch being edited, select the channel from the [guimenu]``View`` drop-down box that contains the packages and click btn:[View]. Packages already associated with the patch being edited are not displayed. Selecting [guimenu]``All managed packages`` presents all available packages.
. After clicking btn:[View], the package list for the selected option appears. Note that the page header still lists the patch being edited.
. In the list, select the check boxes of the packages to be assigned to the edited patch and click btn:[Add Packages].
. A confirmation page appears with the packages listed. Click btn:[Confirm] to associate the packages with the patch. The [guimenu]``List/Remove`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Managed Patch Details`` page appears with the new packages listed.

When packages are assigned to a patch, the patch cache is updated to reflect the changes.
This update is delayed briefly so that users may finish editing a patch before all the changes are made available.
To initiate the changes to the cache manually, follow the directions to btn:[Commit the Changes Immediately] at the top of the page.
