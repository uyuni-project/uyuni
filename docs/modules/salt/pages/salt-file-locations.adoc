= Salt File Locations and Structure


This diagram shows the Salt file structure, as it is used by the {productname} Server.
The files are listed in the [path]``/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf`` configuration file.

The {productname} Server reads Salt state data from five root directories:

[path]``/usr/share/susemanager/salt``::
This directory is shipped and updated with {productname} and includes certificate setup and common state logic to be applied to packages and channels.

[WARNING]
====
Do not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====

[path]``/usr/share/salt-formulas/states``::
[path]``/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states``::
These directories are shipped and updated with {productname} or additional extensions. They inclucde states for salt formulas.

[WARNING]
====
Do not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====

[path]``/srv/susemanager/salt``::
This directory is generated by {productname}, based on assigned channels and packages for clients, groups, and organizations.
This directory will be overwritten and regenerated.
It is the Salt equivalent of the {productname} database.

[WARNING]
====
Do not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====

[path]``/srv/salt``::
This directory is used for custom state data, modules, and related data.
{productname} does not operate or use this directory directly.
The state data in this directory is used by the client highstate, and is merged with the total state result generated by {productname}.
Use this directory for custom Salt data.


The {productname} Server reads Salt pillar data from two root directories:

/usr/share/susemanager/pillar::
This directory is generated by {productname}.
It is shipped and updated together with {productname}.

[WARNING]
====
Do not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====

/srv/pillar::
By default, {productname} does not operate or use this directory directly.
The custom pillar data in this directory is merged with the pillar result created by {productname}.
Use this directory for custom Salt pillar data.
