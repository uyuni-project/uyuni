Feature: Register a Salt minion via XML-RPC API

  Scenario: Delete SLES minion system profile before XML-RPC bootstrap test
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
    When I follow "Delete System"
    And I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    And I click on "Delete Profile"
    Then I should see a "has been deleted" text
    And I cleanup minion: "sle-minion"

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion via XML-RPC
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC system as user "admin" and password "admin"
    When I call system.bootstrap() on host "sle-minion" and saltSSH "disabled", a new system should be bootstraped
    And I logout from XML-RPC system namespace

  Scenario: Check new minion bootstrapped via XML-RPC in System Overview page
     Given I am authorized
     And I go to the minion onboarding page
     Then I should see a "accepted" text
     And the salt-master can reach "sle-minion"
     And I navigate to "rhn/systems/Overview.do" page
     And I wait until I see the name of "sle-minion", refreshing the page
     And I wait until onboarding is completed for "sle-minion"

  Scenario: Check contact method of this minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
    Then I should see a "Default" text

  Scenario: Check spacecmd system ID of minion bootstrapped via XML-RPC
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
    Then I run spacecmd listevents for "sle-minion"

  Scenario: Cleanup: XML-RPC bootstrap: subscribe to base channel
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
    When I follow "Software" in the content area
    And I follow "Software Channels" in the content area
    And I select "Test-Channel-x86_64" from "new_base_channel_id"
    And I click on "Confirm"
    And I click on "Modify Base Software Channel"
    Then I should see a "System's Base Channel has been updated." text
    And I apply highstate on "sle-minion"

  Scenario: Bootstrap via XML-RPC a non-existing system
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC system as user "admin" and password "admin"
    When I call system.bootstrap() on unknown host, I should get an XML-RPC fault with code -1
    And I logout from XML-RPC system namespace

  Scenario: Bootstrap a salt-ssh system with activation key and default contact method
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC system as user "admin" and password "admin"
    When I call system.bootstrap() on a salt minion with saltSSH = true, but with activation key with Default contact method, I should get an XML-RPC fault with code -1
    And I logout from XML-RPC system namespace
