= Push via Salt SSH


Push via Salt SSH is used in environments where Salt clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

The Push via Salt SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the {productname} Server on the internal network to the clients located on the DMZ.
After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed.

The server uses the [command]``salt-ssh`` tool to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events.
For more information about Salt SSH, see xref:salt:salt-ssh.adoc[].

This contact method works for Salt clients only.
For traditional clients, use Push via SSH.

This image demonstrates the Push via Salt SSH process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Taskomatic`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

To use Push via Salt SSH, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the [systemitem]``salt-api`` daemon running on the {productname} Server.
Additionally, Python must be available on the remote system, and be a version supported by Salt.

[NOTE]
====
{rhel}{nbsp}5, {centos}{nbsp}5, and earlier are not supported, as they use unsupported versions of Python.

.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via Salt SSH
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping] and complete the appropriate fields.
. Select an activation key with the Push via SSH contact method configured.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].
. Check the [systemitem]``Manage system completely via SSH`` checkbox.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.
. Confirm that the system has been registered correctly by navigating to menu:Systems[Overview].


When you are configuring Push via Salt SSH, you can modify parameters that are used when a system is registered, including the host, activation key, and password.
The password is used only for bootstrapping, it is not saved anywhere.
All future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair.
These parameters are configured in menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].

You can also configure persistent parameters that are are used system-wide, including the sudo user.
For more information on configuring the sudo user, see the Push via SSH section in this chapter.


The Push via Salt SSH feature uses taskomatic to execute scheduled actions using [command]``salt-ssh``.
The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them.
Unlike Push via SSH on traditional clients, the Push via Salt SSH feature executes a complete [command]``salt-ssh`` call based on the scheduled action.

There are some features that are not yet supported on Push via Salt SSH.
These features will not work on Salt SSH clients:

* OpenSCAP auditing
* Beacons, resulting in:
** Installing a package on a system using [command]``zypper`` will not invoke the package refresh.
** Virtual Host functions (for example, a host to guests) will not work if the virtual host system is Salt SSH-based.
