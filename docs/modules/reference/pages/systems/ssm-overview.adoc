Newer versions created after scheduling are disregarded.
Find the results in the main menu:Main Menu[Schedule] category or within the menu:System Details[Events] tab.



[[ref.webui.systems.ssm.config.subs]]
=== SSM Configuration - Subscribe to Channels

Subscribe systems to configuration channels, and in a second step rank these channels according to the order of preference.
This tab is available only to {productname} Administrators and Configuration Administrators.


image::systems_ssm_config_subscribe_to_channels.png[scaledwidth=80%]



. Select channels for subscription by activating the check box. When done, confirm with btn:[Continue].

+
Then decide how the channels are applied to the selected systems.
The three buttons below the channels reflect your options.
Clicking btn:[Subscribe with Highest Priority] places all the ranked channels before any other channels to which the selected systems are currently subscribed.
Clicking btn:[Subscribe With Lowest Priority] places the ranked channels after those channels to which the selected systems are currently subscribed.
Clicking btn:[Replace Existing Subscriptions] removes any existing association and creates new ones with the ranked channels, leaving every system with the same configuration channels in the same order.
+
.Confliction Ranks
NOTE: In the first two cases, if any of the newly ranked configuration channels are already in a system's existing configuration channel list, the duplicate channel is removed and replaced according to the new rank, effectively reordering the system's existing channels.
When such conflicts exist, you are presented with a confirmation page to ensure the intended action is correct.
When the change has taken place, a message appears at the top of the page indicating the update was successful.
+

Then, click btn:[Apply Subscriptions].

Channels are accessed in the order of their rank.
Your local configuration channel always overrides all other channels.

[[ref.webui.systems.ssm.provision_autoinst]]
=== SSM Provisioning - Autoinstallation


Use this subtab to reinstall clients.


image::systems_ssm_autoinstallation.png[scaledwidth=80%]


To schedule autoinstallations for these systems, select a distribution.
The autoinstallation profile used for each system in the set is determined via the [guimenu]``Autoinstallable Type`` radio buttons.

Choose [guimenu]``Select autoinstallation profile`` to apply the same profile to all systems in the set.
This is the default option.
You will see a list of available profiles to select from when you click btn:[Continue].

Choose [guimenu]``Autoinstall by IP Address`` to apply different autoinstallation profiles to different systems in the set, by IP address.
To do so, at least two autoinstallation profiles must be configured with associated IP ranges.

If you use [guimenu]``Autoinstall by IP Address``, {productname} will automatically pick a profile for each system so that the system's IP address will be in one of the IP ranges specified in the profile itself.
If such a profile cannot be found, {productname} will look for an organization default profile and apply that instead.
If no matching IP ranges nor organization default profiles can be found, no autoinstallation will be performed on the system.
You will be notified on the next page if that happens.

To use Cobbler system records for autoinstallation, select [guimenu]``Create PXE Installation Configuration``.
With PXE boot, you cannot only reinstall clients, but automatically install machines that do not have an operating system installed yet.
{productname} and its network must be properly configured to enable boot using PXE.
For more information on Cobbler and {kickstart} templates, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].


[NOTE]
====
If a system set contains bare-metal systems and installed clients, only features working for systems without an operating system installed will be available.
Full features will be enabled again when all bare-metal systems are removed from the set.
====


If any of the systems connect to {productname} via a proxy server, choose either the [guimenu]``Preserve Existing Configuration`` radio button or the [guimenu]``Use Proxy`` radio button.
If you choose to autoinstall through a proxy server, select from the available proxies listed in the drop-down box beside the [guimenu]``Use Proxy`` radio button.
All of the selected systems will autoinstall via the selected proxy.
Click the btn:[Schedule Autoinstall] button to confirm your selections.
