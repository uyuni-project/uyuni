  In order to move away from traditional clients
  As an authorized user
  I want to migrate these clients to Salt minions and have everything as before

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Migrate a SLES client into a Salt minion

  Scenario: Check that the migrated system is now a minion

    When I follow "Properties" in the content area
    Then I wait until I see "Base System Type:.*Salt" regex, refreshing the page

    Then I should see "sle_client" hostname

  # bsc#1020902 - moving from traditional to Salt with bootstrap is not disabling rhnsd

    When I run "systemctl status nhsd" on "sle_client" without error control
    Then the command should fail

  Scenario: Check that channels are still the same after migration

    Then I should see a "1 package install has been scheduled for" text
    And I wait for "perseus-dummy-1.1-1.1" to be installed on "sle_client"

    When I wait until file "/tmp/remote-command-on-migrated-test" exists on "sle_client"
    And I remove "/tmp/remote-command-on-migrated-test" from "sle_client"

  Scenario: Cleanup: remove package from the migrated minion
