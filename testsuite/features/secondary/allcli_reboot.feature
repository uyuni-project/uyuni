# * However, beware that firmware, kernel or library updates might be activated by the reboot
#   (thus making changes in the behaviour of the system after the reboot)
#
# This feature can cause failures in the following features:
# - features/secondary/min_rhlike_openscap_audit.feature
# - features/secondary/min_rhlike_remote_command.feature

# - features/secondary/min_deblike_openscap_audit.feature
# - features/secondary/min_deblike_remote_command.feature
# - features/secondary/min_deblike_ssh.feature
# If the minions take over the alloted 10 minutes to reboot, 
# the following features could fail due to the minions not being reachable.
# Depending on how long they take to reboot, even more features could fail.
