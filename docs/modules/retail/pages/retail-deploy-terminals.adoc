= Deploy Terminals


When you have the {susemgr} Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps:

. Create hardware type groups
. Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group
. Synchronize images to the branch server
. Deploy images to the terminals

Each procedure is detailed in this section.

If you have many terminals, and would prefer this to be handled with a script, see xref:retail:retail-mass-config.adoc[].

Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image.
For how to build OS images, see xref:administration:image-management.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you have registered new terminals, always check the {susemgr} {webui} to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the {susemgr} Server by mistake.
====


== Create A Hardware Type Group

Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer.
However, at the beginning, the {susemgr} database does not have this information.
To tell {susemgr} what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups.
After you have created your new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment.

Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name.
Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one.

Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration.
If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it.

For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal.

.Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group

. Determine the hardware type group name.
Prefix the name with [systemitem]``HWTYPE:``, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen.
For example:
+
----
HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only use colons (``:``), hyphens (``-``) or underscores (``_``) in hardware type group names.
Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed.
====
. In the {susemgr} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups], and click the btn:[Create Group] button.
. In the [guimenu]``Create System Group`` dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you created earlier.


== Assign and Configure the Saltboot Formula for Each Hardware Type Group

Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied.

.Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula

. Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. Select the Saltboot formula and click btn:[Save].
. Navigate to the menu:Formulas[Saltboot] tab.
. Configure the Saltboot formula according to the instructions in xref:retail:retail-formulas-intro.adoc[].



== Synchronize Images to the Branch Server

.Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server

. On the {susemgr} server, run this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync
----


=== Using a {sles}11 SP3 32-bit based images

If you have 32-bit machines included in your branch, then you must use a 32-bit boot image as a default boot image.

[WARNING]
====
If 32-bit boot image is not used as a default boot image, 32-bit terminals will be unable to boot and operate properly.
====

You can check the available boot images and their architecture from the command line:

----
salt <branch_server_salt_id> pillar.item boot_images
----

Output:

----
POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0:
      ----------
      arch:
          x86_64
      ...
legacy-6.0.0:
      ----------
      arch:
          i686
----

In this example, the [systemitem]``legacy-6.0.0`` boot image is 32-bit.

You can set the default boot image in the ``Image Synchronization`` formula on the branch server, by adding the chosen boot image name to the [guimenu]``Default boot image`` field.
For more information about ``Image Synchronization`` formula, see xref:salt:formula-imagesync.adoc[].

== Deploy Images to the Terminals

.Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals

. Power on your POS terminals.
. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided.
