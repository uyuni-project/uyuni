  In Order to test the remote commands via salt
  As an authorized user

  Scenario: Run a remote command on centos
    Given I am authorized as "testing" with password "testing"
    And I follow "Salt"
    And I follow "Remote Commands"

    Then I enter command "cat /etc/os-release"
    And I click on preview

    Then I wait for "3" seconds
    And I expand the results for "ceos-minion"
