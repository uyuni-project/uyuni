Usage:
    make tag-release    Bump version of the package and tag the commit.

    make tag-minor-release      Bump release of the package and tag the commit.

        After running make tag-release or tag-minor-release, the tag is
        only in your local repository. Review the changes
        (try: gitk --all &) and then push the commit and the new tag to
        the upstream repository, or make srpm will use the old tag (or
        not work at all):

        git push
        git push ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/ tag <the-tag>

    make srpm           Build .src.rpm from latest tagged release of the
                        package. The tag has to be not only in the local
                        repository but also in the upstream repo.

        The srpm target understands one parameter, DIST. Use it to build
        .src.rpm with this %{dist} instead of your own, to match whatever
        your build system expects. Do not forget the leading dot. Example:
                make srpm DIST=.el5.sw

    make tgz            Create the tar.gz for the latest tagged release of
            the package.

    make upload-tgz     Create the tar.gz for the latest tagged release of
            the package and upload it to fedorahosted.org.
            If yours account differs from your current login you may want
            to add to ~/.ssh/config those lines:
            host *.fedorahosted.org
              user <username>
            host fedorahosted.org
              user <username>

    make test-srpm      Packs source from local HEAD and builds srpm locally.
                        You can then rpmbuild it on your machine or
                        elsewhere. The package has git commit SHA1 in its
                        Release. The .src.rpm will be left in your working
                        directory.

    make test-rpm       Packs source from local HEAD and builds both srpm
                        and binary rpm locally. The package has git commit
                        SHA1 in its Release. The .src.rpm will be left in
                        your working directory, the .rpm(s) in some noarch
                        or arch subdirectories.

        The Makefile.git includes file ~/.spacewalk-build-rc if it exists.
        You might want to put line like
                RPMBUILD_BASEDIR = /tmp/spacewalk-build
        there, the path pointing to directory where builds will take place
        and where .rpm will land (instead of your working tree).

The Makefile in package's directory should specify NAME and SPECFILE, and
then include this Makefile, via

        include .../rel-eng/Makefile

If you do not want the directory to be packed to .tar.gz for packages where
we are not the upstream, specify

        NO_TAR_GZ = 1

in the Makefile. In that case, you need to have that upstream's .tar.gz in
the repository already.

If you want some sources to be downloaded from external URIs, specify

        DOWNLOAD_SOURCES = http://www.example.com/path/source-1.2.3.tar.gz

in the Makefile, and the URL will be fetched via wget upon make (test-)srpm.
