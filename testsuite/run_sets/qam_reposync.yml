# This file describes the order of features in a QAM test-suite run.
#
# This test-suite is prepared to run a Maintenance Update test passing by parameter (env. variable) a JSON type
# containing a dictionary with clients and their salt & traditional repositories
# We might also need an upgrade of packages in server side, on that case, sumaform will handle the update on deployment stage.
# It will run in a clean environment, not in a long-running server, so we don't need to take care of cleaning.
