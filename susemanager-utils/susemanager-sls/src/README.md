## Python Code Maintenance

If the code not yet in here but on older places:

1. Move your .py file to the appropriate location (_modules -> modules, _beacons -> beacons etc)
2. Write a test as a separate .py test file in "tests"
3. Run tests, using PyTest
4. Update .spec file accordingly

If all the Python code is already here and tested, delete __this__ README file.
