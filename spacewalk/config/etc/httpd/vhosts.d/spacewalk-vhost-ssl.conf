# Template for a VirtualHost with SSL
# Note: to use the template, rename it to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/yourvhost.conf.
# Files must have the .conf suffix to be loaded.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.QUICKSTART for further hints
# about virtual hosts.
#
# This is the Apache server configuration file providing SSL support.
# It contains the configuration directives to instruct the server how to
# serve pages over an https connection. For detailing information about these 
# directives see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.
