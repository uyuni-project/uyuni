SUSE Software License Agreement
</p><p>
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY PURCHASING, INSTALLING 
AND/OR USING THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ITS COMPONENTS), YOU AGREE TO 
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND 
UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO 
NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON 
BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY.
</p><p>
This SUSE Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal 
agreement between You (an entity or a person) and Novell, Inc., SUSE 
business unit ("SUSE"). The software product identified in the title 
of this Agreement, its structure, organization, and accompanying 
documentation (collectively the "Software") is protected by the 
copyright laws and treaties of the United States and other countries 
and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Any modification, 
update, enhancement or upgrade to the Software that You may download 
or receive that are not accompanied by a SUSE software license 
agreement expressly is included as Software and governed by this 
Agreement. 
</p><p>
LICENSES. The Software and each of its components are owned by SUSE 
or other licensors and are protected under copyright laws and other 
applicable laws. Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement and the restrictions on use of the Database (as 
set forth below), SUSE grants to You a perpetual, non-transferable, 
worldwide license to reproduce and use copies of the Software within 
Your Organization (as defined below). Many of the individual 
components included in the Software are licensed pursuant to an open 
source license identified in the documentation or located in the 
source code or binary code for the component.  This Agreement does 
not limit Your rights under such licenses or supersede or conflict 
with the license terms or obligations for use of any individual open 
source component.  
</p><p>
"Organization" means a legal entity, excluding subsidiaries and 
affiliates with a separate existence for tax purposes or for legal 
personality purposes. An example of an Organization in the private 
sector would be a corporation, partnership, or trust, excluding any 
subsidiaries or affiliates of the organization with a separate tax 
identification number or company registration number. In the public 
sector, an example of Organization would be a specific government 
body or local government authority.
</p><p>
MARKS. No right or license, express or implied, is granted under 
this Agreement with respect to any trademark, trade name or service 
mark of SUSE or its affiliates or licensors ("Mark"). If You 
distribute any open source component of the Software, You must 
remove all Marks except those used to identify SUSE's ownership or 
licensing of the component.
</p><p>
SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.  SUSE sells Subscription Services for the 
Software that entitle You to fee based technical support and 
internal use of Software updates provided during the Subscription 
Service period purchased and subject to the terms of the applicable 
Subscription Service offering. The fee charged for Subscription 
Services for this Software is based on the total number of Instances 
of the Software You deploy, install or use. An "Instance" is defined 
as the initial copy of the Software necessary for execution of the 
Software and each additional copy (or partial copy) of the Software 
stored or loaded in memory or virtual memory.  For the avoidance of 
doubt, the following activities are not authorized under 
Subscription Services and are a material breach of this Agreement:  
(1) Providing updates received under Subscription Services to a 
third party, (2) purchasing or renewing Subscription Services for 
less than the total number of Instances of the Software You deploy, 
install or use, and (3) using Subscription Services to provide 
support to third parties.
</p><p>
PROPRIETARY DATABASE SOFTWARE. This paragraph applies to You only if 
You have purchased the SUSE Manager Server with Database offering. 
The Software includes a version of the Oracle database software 
("Database"). For each Instance of Subscription Services You have 
purchased for the Software, You are authorized to use one Instance 
of the Database solely for use with the Software for which You have 
purchased the Subscription.  In addition to the terms of this 
Agreement, Your use of the Database is subject to the Third Party 
Addendum included with this Agreement.
</p><p>
TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS
</p><p>
SUSE reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. You may not: 
(1) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except 
and only to the extent it is expressly permitted by applicable law; 
or (2) transfer the Software or Your license rights under this 
Agreement, in whole or in part.
</p><p>
SUSE has no obligation to provide support or maintenance unless You 
purchase an offering that expressly includes support or maintenance 
services. If You make such a purchase and no separate agreement 
specifically applies to the support or maintenance services, then 
the terms of this Agreement will govern the provision of such 
support or maintenance services ("Services"). For more information 
on SUSE's current support offerings, see http://www.suse.com/support.
</p><p>
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS
</p><p>
No title to or ownership of the Software is transferred to You. SUSE 
and/or its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to 
all intellectual property rights in the Software and Services, 
including any adaptations or copies thereof. Any materials You 
receive as part of the Services that are not accompanied by terms 
expressly superseding this Agreement are Software and governed by 
this Agreement. You acquire only a conditional license to use the 
Software. The Software is licensed (not sold) to You.
</p><p>
LIMITED WARRANTY
</p><p>
Except as agreed to under a separate written agreement with SUSE or 
as may be set forth in the license terms accompanying a particular 
component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the 
Software is provided and licensed "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF 
ANY KIND, express or implied, including any implied warranties of 
merchantability, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular 
purpose.  For sixty (60) days from the date of delivery, SUSE 
warrants that any media on which the Software is delivered is free 
from physical defects under normal use.  If the defective items are 
returned to SUSE or if You report the nonconformity to SUSE within 
the sixty (60) day warranty period, SUSE will at its option either 
replace the media or refund the fees You paid for the media. This 
warranty extends only to media provided by SUSE.  Any unauthorized 
use or modification of the Software voids this warranty.
</p><p>
Other Services. SUSE warrants that any consulting or technical 
support services purchased absent a separate written agreement for 
such services will be supplied in a professional manner in 
accordance with generally accepted industry standards. This warranty 
will be effective for ninety (90) days following delivery of the 
Services. Upon any breach of this warranty, SUSE's only obligation 
is to either correct the Services so that they comply with this 
warranty or at its option refund the amount You paid to SUSE for the 
portion of the Services that fail to comply with this warranty. As 
files may be altered or damaged in the course of SUSE providing 
technical services, You agree to take appropriate measures to 
isolate and back up Your systems.
</p><p>
THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS 
ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE 
OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, 
OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, 
OR OTHER USES IN WHICH FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY 
TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL 
DAMAGE.
</p><p>
THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN COMPUTERS AND OPERATING 
SYSTEMS. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT WARRANTED FOR NON-COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS. 
Call SUSE or Your reseller for information about compatibility.
</p><p>
Non-SUSE Products. The Software may include or be bundled with 
hardware or other software programs or services licensed or sold by 
an entity other than SUSE. SUSE DOES NOT WARRANT NON-SUSE PRODUCTS 
OR SERVICES. ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS 
IS" BASIS. WARRANTY SERVICE IF ANY FOR NON-SUSE PRODUCTS IS PROVIDED 
BY THE PRODUCT LICENSOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LICENSOR 
WARRANTY.
</p><p>
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LAW, SUSE DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES 
ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR 
NON-INFRINGEMENT. SUSE MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE 
NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. SUSE DOES NOT 
WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS 
OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE 
UNINTERRUPTED. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers 
and limitations of warranties, so portions of the above limitations 
may not apply to You. This limited warranty gives You specific 
rights and You may also have other rights which vary by state or 
jurisdiction.
</p><p>
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</p><p>
(a) Consequential Losses. 
NEITHER SUSE NOR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, OR EMPLOYEES 
WILL IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, TORT, ECONOMIC OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS OR DATA, EVEN 
IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.
(b) Direct Damages. 
IN NO EVENT WILL SUSE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES TO 
PROPERTY OR PERSON (WHETHER IN ONE INSTANCE OR A SERIES OF 
INSTANCES) EXCEED 1.25 TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE 
OR SERVICES OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE [OR $50 (U.S.) IF YOU 
RECEIVED THE SOFTWARE FREE OF CHARGE]. The above exclusions and 
limitations will not apply to claims relating to death or personal 
injury. In those jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of damages, SUSE's liability shall be limited or excluded 
to the maximum extent allowed within those jurisdictions.
</p><p>
GENERAL TERMS
</p><p>
Term. 
This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire the 
Software and will automatically terminate if You breach any of its 
terms. 
</p><p>
Verification. 
SUSE may, upon fifteen (15) days' advance notice and at its expense, 
conduct an annual audit, during your normal business hours, of your 
use of the Software and Documentation to verify compliance with this 
Agreement.  You agree to implement internal safeguards to prevent 
any unauthorized copying, distribution, installation, or use of, or 
access to, the Software.  You further agree to keep records 
sufficient to certify your compliance with this Agreement, and, upon 
request of SUSE, provide and certify metrics and/or reports based 
upon such records and accounting both numbers of copies (by product 
and version) and network architectures as they may reasonably relate 
to your licensing and deployment of the Software.  You shall provide 
SUSE or an authorized representative with access to records, 
hardware and employees in order to perform the audit.  Upon SUSE's 
or its authorized representative's presentation of their reasonable 
written commitment(s) to safeguard your confidential information, 
you shall fully cooperate with such audit and provide any necessary 
assistance and access to records and computers.  If an audit reveals 
that you have or at any time have had unlicensed installation, use 
of, or access to the Software, You will promptly acquire sufficient 
licenses to cover any shortage.  If a material license shortage of 
5% or more is found, you must reimburse SUSE for the costs incurred 
in the audit and acquire the necessary additional licenses within 30 
days without the benefit of any otherwise applicable discount.  
</p><p>
Benchmark Testing. 
This benchmark testing restriction applies to You if You are a 
software developer or licensor or if You are performing testing on 
the Software at the direction of or on behalf of a software 
developer or licensor. You may not, without SUSE's prior written 
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, publish or disclose to any 
third party the results of any benchmark test of the Software. If 
You are a licensor of products that are functionally similar to or 
compete with the Software ("Similar Products"), or are acting on 
behalf of such a licensor, and You publish or disclose benchmark 
information on the Software in violation of this restriction, then 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Similar Product's 
end user license agreement, and in addition to any other remedies 
SUSE may have, SUSE shall have the right to perform benchmark 
testing on Similar Products and to disclose and publish that 
benchmark information and You hereby represent that You have 
authority to grant such right to SUSE.
</p><p>
Transfer. 
This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned without the prior 
written approval of SUSE.

of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, this 
Agreement is governed by the laws of that country, and any action at 
law may only be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction of 
that country.

between You and SUSE and may be amended or modified only by a 
written agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative 
of SUSE. NO LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES

THIRD PARTY ADDENDUM
</p><p>
The Software contains database software licensed by SUSE or its 
affiliates from Oracle America, Inc. ("Oracle"). For purposes of 
this addendum, the term "program" refers to the Oracle database 
software. Oracle requires that You agree to the following terms 
regarding use of the program. You may only use the Oracle program in 
conjunction with the SUSE Manager Server with Database Software and 
not as a general purpose database in support of other applications. 
You agree to comply with the following:
</p><p>
1) Use of the program is limited to the legal entity that executed 
the SUSE Manager with Database Software License Agreement.
2) Use of the program is restricted to the scope of the application 
package with which You received it and to Your internal business 
operations. You may permit agents or contractors (including, without 
limitation, outsourcers) to use the application package on Your 
behalf. You are responsible for Your agent's, contractor's, 
outsourcer's, customer's and supplier's use of the application 
package and compliance with the end user license agreement.
3) Oracle or its licensor retains all ownership and intellectual 
property rights to the program.
4) The following are prohibited: 
(a) use of the program for rental, timesharing, subscription 
service, hosting, or outsourcing; 
(b) the removal or modification of any program markings or any 
notice of Oracle's or its licensors' proprietary rights; 
(c) making the programs available in any manner to any third party 
for use in the third party's business operations (unless such access 
is expressly permitted for the specific program license); 
(d) reverse engineering (unless required by law for 
interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the programs (the 
foregoing prohibition includes but is not limited to review of data 
structures or similar materials produced by programs); and 
(e) publication of any results of benchmark tests run on the 
programs.
</p><p>
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Oracle disclaims 
liability for (a) any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, 
special, punitive or consequential, and (b) any loss of profits, 
revenue, data or data use, arising from the use of the programs. You 
agree to permit SUSE to audit Your use of the programs and report 
the audit results to Oracle or allow Oracle to perform the audit at 
Your cost. Oracle is a third party beneficiary of this addendum and 
the end user license agreement (with respect only to the program). 
The application of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act 
is excluded.
