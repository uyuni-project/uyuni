Feature: Disable and re-enable monitoring of the server

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section
  # This assumes that monitoring is enabled via sumaform
  Scenario: Disable monitoring from the UI
    When I follow the left menu "Admin > Manager Configuration > Monitoring"
    And I wait until I see "Server self monitoring" text
    And I click on "Disable"
    And I wait until button "Disable" becomes enabled
    Then I should see a "Monitoring disabled successfully." text
    And I should see a list item with text "System" and a failing bullet
    And I should see a list item with text "PostgreSQL database" and a failing bullet
    And I should see a list item with text "Server self monitoring" and a warning bullet
    And I should see a list item with text "Taskomatic (Java JMX)" and a warning bullet

  Scenario: Restart spacewalk services to apply config changes after disabling monitoring
    When I restart the spacewalk service
