Feature: Test weak dependencies
  In Order to validate the new added weak dependencies feature
  As an authorized user
  I want to see the weak deps in the package page and in the metadata on the client

  Background:
    Given I am authorized as "admin" with password "admin"
    When I follow "Channels"
    And I follow "Software Channels"
    And I follow "All Channels"

  Scenario: Check Package metadata displayed in WebUI (Supplements)
    And I follow "SLES11-SP3-Updates x86_64 Channel"
    And I follow "Packages"
    And I follow "virgo-dummy-2.0-1.1.noarch"
    And I follow "Dependencies"
    Then I should see a "Recommends" text
    And I should see a "Suggests" text
    And I should see a "Supplements" text
    And I should see a "packageand(a-blackhole:dummy)" text

  Scenario: Check Package metadata displayed in WebUI (Recommends)
    And I follow "SLES11-SP3-Updates x86_64 Channel"
    And I follow "Packages"
    And I follow "milkyway-dummy-2.0-1.1.x86_64"
    And I follow "Dependencies"
    Then I should see a "Recommends" text
