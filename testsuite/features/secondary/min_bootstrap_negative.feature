Feature: Negative tests for bootstrapping normal minions
  In order to register only valid minions 
  As an authorized user
  I want to avoid registration with invalid input parameters

  Scenario: Bootstrap should fail when minion already exists
     Given I am authorized
     And I go to the bootstrapping page
     Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
     When I enter the hostname of "sle_minion" as "hostname"
     And I enter "22" as "port"
     And I enter "root" as "user"
     And I enter "linux" as "password"
     And I click on "Bootstrap"
     And I wait until I see "A salt key for this host" text
     Then I should not see a "GenericSaltError" text
     And I should see a "seems to already exist, please check!" text

  Scenario: Delete SLES minion system profile before bootstrap negative tests
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Delete System"
    Then I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    When I click on "Delete Profile"
    And I wait until I see "has been deleted" text
    And I cleanup minion "sle_minion"
    Then "sle_minion" should not be registered

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion with wrong hostname
     Given I am authorized

     And I enter "22" as "port"
     And I enter "root" as "user"
     And I enter "linux" as "password"
     And I click on "Bootstrap"
     And I wait until I see " Could not resolve hostname not-existing-name: Name or service not known" text
     Then I should not see a "GenericSaltError" text

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion with wrong SSH credentials
     Given I am authorized
     And I go to the bootstrapping page

     Then I should not see a "GenericSaltError" text

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion with wrong SSH port number
     Given I am authorized
     And I go to the bootstrapping page
     Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text

     And I enter "11" as "port"
     And I enter "root" as "user"
     And I enter "linux" as "password"
     And I click on "Bootstrap"

     Then I should not see a "GenericSaltError" text
     And I should see a "port 11: Connection refused" text or "port 11: Invalid argument" text

  Scenario: Cleanup: bootstrap a SLES minion after negative tests
     Given I am authorized
     When I go to the bootstrapping page
     Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
     When I enter the hostname of "sle_minion" as "hostname"
     And I enter "22" as "port"
