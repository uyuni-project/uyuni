In addition, [guimenu]``Per-User Subscription Restrictions`` can be set globally by {productname} administrators and channel administrators.
By default, any user can subscribe channels to a system.
To manage user permissions, select [guimenu]``Only selected users within your organization may subscribe to this channel`` and click btn:[Update].
The [guimenu]``Subscribers`` tab appears.
Click it to grant specific users subscription permissions to a channel.
{productname} administrators and channel administrators can always subscribe any channels to a system.

Only customers with custom base channels can change their systems' base channel assignments via the {productname} Web interface in two ways:

* Assign the system to a custom base channel.
* Revert subscriptions from a custom base channel to the appropriate distribution-based base channel.

[NOTE]
====
The assigned base channel must match the installed system.
For example, a system running {sle}{nbsp}11 for `x86_64` cannot be registered to a {sle}{nbsp}12 for `s390x` base channel.
Use the files [path]``/etc/os-release`` or [path]``/etc/SuSE-release`` to check your product, architecture (try [command]``uname -a``), version, and patch level.
