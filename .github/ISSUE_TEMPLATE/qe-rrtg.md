- Duplicate this section if you review multiple branches whom must be submitted during your card.
- As soon as a blocker is resolved, mark it on the list. This list must be updated ASAP, release engineers are monitoring it. Furthermore, we need to track all the issues that could delay a submission
- Add additional information to a blocker in a new comment below and keep that list clean and simple
