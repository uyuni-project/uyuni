Feature: Be able to register a CentOS 7 traditional client and do some basic operations on it

  Scenario: Prepare a CentOS 7 traditional client
     Given I am authorized
     When I run "sed s/enabled=.*/enabled=1/g /etc/yum.repos.d/Devel_Galaxy_Manager_Head_RES-Manager-Tools-7-x86_64.repo -i" on "ceos-minion" without error control
     And  I run "sed s/enabled=.*/enabled=1/g /etc/yum.repos.d/SLE-Manager-Tools-RES-7-x86_64.repo -i" on "ceos-minion" without error control
     And  I run "sed s/enabled=.*/enabled=1/g /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo -i" on "ceos-minion" without error control
     And  I run "yum repolist" on "ceos-minion"
     And  I run "yum install -y --nogpgcheck rhn-client-tools rhn-check rhn-setup rhnsd hwdata m2crypto wget osad rhncfg-actions" on "ceos-minion"
     And  I run "yum install -y --nogpgcheck spacewalk-oscap scap-security-guide" on "ceos-minion"
     And  I register the centos7 as tradclient
     And  I run "rhn-actions-control --enable-all" on "ceos-minion"

    And I enter "--profile common" as "params"
    And I enter "/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-centos7-xccdf.xml" as "path"

     When I authenticate to XML-RPC
     And I refresh the packages on "ceos-minion" through XML-RPC
     And I run a script on "ceos-minion" through XML-RPC
     And I reboot "ceos-minion" through XML-RPC
