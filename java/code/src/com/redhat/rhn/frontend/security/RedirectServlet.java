/**
 * RedirectServlet redirects GET requests. All requests whose URI starts with
 * <code>/rhn/Redirect</code> will be processed by this servlet. The redirect URL will
 * consist of the full URL including the query string, except that the <code>/rhn/Redirect
 * </code> portion of the URI will be stripped out. This is best illustrated with an
 * example:
 * <p>
 * Request URL:
 * <code>https://somehost.redhat.com/rhn/Redirect/rhn/systems/Overview.do</code>
 * <p>
 * Redirect URL: <code>https://somehost.redhat.com/rhn/systems/Overview.do</code>
 * <p>
 * The use case for RedirectServlet is for supporting perl in a hosted environment when
 * SSO authentication is enabled. The SSO authentication logic has not and will not be
 * ported to the perl code base; consequently, perl will continue to rely solely on the PXT
 * authentication model. This is fine since the SSO authentication service will create,
 * refresh, and invalidate the PXT session as necessary. A problem exists though in the
 * following scenario in which a request does not go through the servlet filters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>User goes to https://somehost/dev/index.pxt.</li>
 *   <li>Since the user has not logged in, she is redirected to the SSO app.</li>
 *   <li>
 *     User logs in through SSO and is redirected back to https://somehost/dev/index.pxt.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The PXT session has not been created, so the user will again be redirected back to
 *     SSO.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If PXT authentication fails, perl can redirect the request to SSO. RedirectServlet should
 * be included in the callback URL as described above. This will ensure that when SSO
 * redirects the client that the request will be filtered by the appropriate servlet
 * filters, ensuring that the PXT session is created. RedirectServlet will then handle
 * redirecting the request back to the originally requested perl page.
