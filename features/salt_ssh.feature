Feature: 1) Bootstrap a new salt host via salt-ssh
   verify functionality: script, remote cmds, packages install, channel subscription.
  2) delete the ssh-minion
  3) bootstap a ssh-minion tunneled by ssh-reverse. 
     verify functionality: script, remote cmds, packages install, channel subscription.
     verify tunnel proprety: repo 1233 port, and installation of pkg only via server.
