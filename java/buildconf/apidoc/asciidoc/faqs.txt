= Frequently Asked Questions

== What programming languages are supported by the $productName API?

Any language that provides an XMLRPC client interface will work with the $productName API. While
Perl and Python are two of the most commonly used, an XMLRPC client implementation is available for every
common language.

== When trying to call a specific function, the error "Fault returned from XML RPC Server, fault code -1: Could not find method METHOD in class..."  is given. What is wrong?

Typically this is seen when either a function name is being called that doesn't exist, the number
of parameters for a particular function is incorrect, or the type of a passed parameter is incorrect (Such as
an array is expected, but a String is passed). Check all of these things.

== Should I call an API method using the naming scheme "methodName" or "method_name"?

Both of these are valid names for the same method, so use whichever you prefer.
