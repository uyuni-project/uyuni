= Virtual Host Managers

Virtual Host Managers (VHMs) are used to gather information from a range of client types.

VHMs can be used to collect private or public cloud instances and organize them into virtualization groups.
With your virtualized clients organized this way, Taskomatic collects data on the clients for display in the {productname}{ {webui}.
VHMs also allow you to use subscription matching on your virtualized clients.

You can create a VHM on your {productname} Server, and use it to inventory available public cloud instances.
You can also use a VHM to manage clusters created with {k8s} and {caasp}.

For more information on using a VHM with Microsoft Azure, see xref:client-configuration:vhm-azure.adoc[].
For more information on using a VHM with Amazon Web Services, see xref:client-configuration:vhm-aws.adoc[].
For more information on using a VHM with Google Compute Engine, see xref:client-configuration:vhm-gce.adoc[].

//For more information on using a VHM with {caasp}, see xref:client-configuration:vhm-caasp.adoc[].



== SUSE Support and VM Zones

Public cloud providers use regions to define the physical geographic location of the datacenter providing virtual machines.
For example, [systemitem]``US-East``, or [systemitem]``Asia``.

Regions are then further divided into zones.
For example, the [systemitem]``US-East`` region might contain zones called [systemitem]``us-east-2a`` and [systemitem]``us-east-2b``, among others.

{suse} uses the zone of a virtual machine to determine the appropriate subscription to provide.
If all of your VMs are provided by the same zone, you are within the terms and conditions of the ``1-2 Virtual Machines`` subscription.

If your VMs are provided by different zones, even if they are within the same region, you might not meet the conditions of the ``1-2 Virtual Machines`` subscription.
In this case, check your subscription carefully.
