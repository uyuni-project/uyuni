Feature: Correct timezone display 
#  1) create a user and assign him a timezone different than the server's timezone
#  2) test that the popups in some scheduling actions appear in user's prefered timezone 
#  3) some scheduler tests based on previous bugs are unavoidable

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Create a new user in a timezone different than server's timezone
    When I follow the left menu "Users > User List > Active"
