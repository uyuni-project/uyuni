# rhn.conf.sample - THIS FILE IS USED FOR REFERENCE ONLY!
#
# The /etc/rhn/rhn.conf file should be created initially upon install.
#
# This file will attempt to better illustrate the possible settings for
# the file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf.
#

# How this configuration scheme works:
#
# Settings are structured hierarchically. All main components (RHN Server
# Server Satellite, and web) currently use this file. Settings are
# differentiated by a dot-delimited
# prefix. For example (ignore the initial comments; this is an illustration).
#
# debug = 3  # All debug levels for all components is 3
# traceback_mail = xxx@redhat.com # all tracebacks for all components go to
#                                 # xxx@redhat.com.
# proxy.traceback_mail = yyy@redhat.com # All proxy (broker & redirect) emails
#                                       # go to yyy@redhat.com now (overriding
#                                       # xxx@redhat.com).
# proxy.broker.debug = 4  # Spacewalk Proxy broker now runs at debug level 4, but
#                         # redirect and auth_cache still run at debug level 3


#### THE SETTINGS ####
# NOTE: All settings listed are the defaults unless overridden
#       Items left uncommented are the settings most likely needing to be
#       changed.
#
# Common (global to all components) settings
#
#debug = 5
traceback_mail = user0@example.com, user1@example.com
#quiet_mail = 15 # can set in other components... no need to change though.

### COMPONENT DEFINITIONS ###
#
# *global*          - if the option is defined without a component prepended,
#                     then that option is set globally unless overridden.
#                     E.g. traceback_mail = bob@company.com, mary@company.com
#
# server            - all components that are of base component type "server"
#                     will inherit these settings.
#
# server.satellite  - settings for the satellite component of the RHN Server.
#                     E.g. server.satellite.traceback_mail = jill@company.com
#                     (all error message for all server.satellite components
#                     now are sent to Jill, whereas non-server.satellite
#                     component error messages are still sent to Bob and Mary).
#
# server.app
#                   - settings for the app components of the RHN Server.
#
# web               - XXX: web stuff




### CONFIGURATION OPTION DEFINITIONS ###
#
#   NOTE: All components don't necessary understand all options listed below.
#         Use the sample settings above as a reference as to what can and cannot
#         be set. Comment (#) anything you wish to be unset/defaulted.
#
#   ** SERVER COMPONENT OPTIONS**
#
#   traceback_mail  - indicates where tracebacks (crash information) is mailed.
#                     traceback_mail = user0@company.com, user1@company.com
#                     NOTE: any options with a comma indicates a list of items.
#
#   quiet_mail      - The two main components of the Spacewalk Proxy Solution (broker
#                     and redirect) use Apache extensively. As Apache reuses
#                     processes, sometimes an error may occurs that generates
#                     multiple copies of the same "traceback". The quiet_mail
#                     setting limits the number of duplicate tracebacks sent
#                     from 1 error.
#
#   debug           - Debug level. To increase verbosity of logs to the log
#                     files, increase the value.
#                     Debug levels are arbitrary to a certain degree, but here
#                     is a rough summary of what each means:
#                     LEVEL   MEANING
#                     0       nearly nothing at all is logged
#                     1       minimal debug information logged
#                     2       some debug information logged
#                     3       somewhat verbose (most function calls and methods
#                             are logged)
#                     4       verbose
#                     5       very verbose (nearly everything)
#                     6       everything including some things only meaningful
#                             to developers
#
#   log_file        - each component can have it's own log file.
#
#   mount_point     - FIXME
#
#   encrypted_passwords
#                   - client passwords can be stored encrypted or plaintext
#                     in the database. Possible values are 0 and 1.
#
#   http_proxy      - this is only used for component server.satellite and is
#                     only important to the satellite-sync tool. If one must
#                     connect to Red Hat's servers via a corporate http_proxy
#                     it can be set here. To leave it unset, either comment
#                     that line or leave the value blank.
#                     e.g. somehttpproxy.example.com:8080
#                     ...or, to leave unset:
#                     e.g. proxy.broker.http_proxy =
#
#   http_proxy_username
#   http_proxy_password
#                   - username and password for that http_proxy if need be.
#
#
#   ** WEB COMPONENT OPTIONS**
#
#   download_url    - FIXME
#
#   mail_server_errors = user0@redhat.com, user1@redhat.com
#
#   session_swap_secret_1
#   session_swap_secret_2
#   session_swap_secret_3
#   session_swap_secret_4
#                   - these are produced by the initial installation. Do not
#                     even think of altering these.
#
#   session_secret_1
#   session_secret_2
#   session_secret_3
#   session_secret_4
#                   - these are produced by the initial installation. Do not
#                     even think of altering these.
