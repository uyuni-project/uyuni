Feature: Build OS images

  Scenario: Login as Kiwi image administrator and build an image
    Given I am authorized as "kiwikiwi" with password "kiwikiwi"
    When I navigate to images build webpage
    And I select "suse_os_image" from "profileId"
    And I select sle-minion hostname in Build Host
    And I click on "submit-btn"

  Scenario: Check the OS image built as Kiwi image administrator
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
    When I wait at most 3300 seconds until event "Image Build suse_os_image scheduled by kiwikiwi" is completed
    And I wait at most 300 seconds until event "Image Inspect 1//suse_os_image:latest scheduled by kiwikiwi" is completed
    And I navigate to "os-images/1/" page
    Then I should see a "POS_Image_JeOS6" text

  Scenario: Cleanup: remove the image from SUSE Manager server
    Given I am authorized as "admin" with password "admin"
