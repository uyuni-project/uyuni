Feature: Negative tests for bootstrapping normal minions
  In order to register only valid minions
  As an authorized user
  I want to avoid registration with invalid input parameters

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Bootstrap should fail when minion already exists
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > Bootstrapping"
    Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
    When I enter the hostname of "sle_minion" as "hostname"
    And I enter "22" as "port"
    And I enter "root" as "user"
    And I enter "linux" as "password"
    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "A salt key for this host" text
    Then I should not see a "GenericSaltError" text
    And I should see a "seems to already exist, please check!" text

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion with wrong hostname
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > Bootstrapping"

    And I enter "22" as "port"
    And I enter "root" as "user"
    And I enter "linux" as "password"
    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "An error has occurred during salt execution: unable to establish ssh connection." text
    Then I should see a "Details" button
    When I click on "Details"
    And I wait at most 10 seconds until I see modal containing "Error Details" text
    Then I should see a "Standard Error" text
    And I should see "Could not resolve hostname not-existing-name: Name or service not known" in the textarea
    When I close the modal dialog

  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES minion with wrong SSH credentials
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > Bootstrapping"

    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "An error has occurred during salt execution: unable to establish ssh connection." text
    Then I should see a "Details" button
    When I click on "Details"
