= Image Building and Management



[[at.images.overview]]
== Image Building Overview

{productname} enables system administrators to build containers and OS Images and push the result in image stores.
The workflow looks like this:

. Define an image store
. Define an image profile and associate it with a source (either a git repository or a directory)
. Build the image
. Push the image to the image store

{productname} supports two distinct build types: dockerfile, and the Kiwi image system.




[[at.images.docker]]
== Container Images

image::image-building.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[at.images.docker.requirements]]
=== Requirements


The containers feature is available for Salt clients running {sles} 12 or later.
Before you begin, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

* A published git repository repository containing a dockerfile and configuration scripts.
The repository can be public or private, and should be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
* A properly configured image store, such as a Docker registry.
+

[NOTE]
====
If you require a private image registry you can use an open source solution such as ``Portus``.
For additional information on setting up Portus as a registry provider, see the http://port.us.org/[Portus Documentation].
====
+

For more information on Containers or {caasp}, see:

* https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/book-sles-docker.html
* https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/



[[at.images.docker.buildhost]]
=== Create a Build Host


To build images with {productname}, you will need to create and configure a build host.
Container build hosts are Salt clients running {sle} 12 or later.
This section guides you through the initial configuration for a build host.

From the {productname} {webui}, perform these steps to configure a build host:


. Select a Salt client to be designated as a build host from the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
. From the [guimenu]``System Details`` page of the selected client assign the containers modules.
Go to menu:Software[Software Channels] and enable the containers module (for example, [guimenu]``SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool`` and [guimenu]``SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates``).
Confirm by clicking btn:[Change Subscriptions].
. From the menu:System Details[Properties] page, enable ``Container Build Host`` from the [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` list and confirm by clicking btn:[Update Properties].
. Install all required packages by applying ``Highstate``.
From the system details page select menu:States[Highstate] and click [guimenu]``Apply Highstate``.
Alternatively, apply Highstate from the {productname} Server command line:
+
----
salt '$your_client' state.highstate
----



[[at.images.docker.buildchannels]]
=== Create an Activation Key for Containers


The containers built using {productname} will use channel(s) associated to the activation key as repositories when building the image. This section will guide you into creating an ad-hoc activation key for this purpose.

[NOTE]
====
To build a container, you will need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than `SUSE Manager Default`.
====

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Select menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Enter a [guimenu]``Description`` and a [guimenu]``Key`` name.
Use the drop-down menu to select the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` to associate with this key.
. Confirm with btn:[Create Activation Key].

For more information, see <<bp.key.managment>>.



[[at.images.docker.imagestore]]
=== Create an Image Store


All built images are pushed to an image store.
This section contains information about creating an image store.

image::images_image_stores.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Select menu:Images[Stores].
. Click [guimenu]``Create`` to create a new store.
+

image::images_image_stores_create.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Define a name for the image store in the [guimenu]``Label`` field.
. Provide the path to your image registry by filling in the [guimenu]``URI`` field, as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the container registry host (whether internal or external).
+

----
registry.example.com
----
+

The Registry URI can also be used to specify an image store on a registry that is already in use.
+

----
registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject
----

. Click btn:[Create] to add the new image store.



[[at.images.docker.profile]]
=== Create an Image Profile


All container images are built using an image profile, which contains the building instructions.
This section contains information about creating an image profile with the {productname} {webui}.

image::images_image_profiles.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Create an Image Profile
. To create an image profile select menu:Images[Profiles] and click btn:[Create].
+

image::images_image_create_profile.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Provide a name for the image profile by filling in the [guimenu]``Label`` field.
+

[NOTE]
====
Only lowercase characters are permitted in container labels.
If your container image tag is in a format such as `myproject/myimage`, make sure your image store registry URI contains the `/myproject` suffix.
====

. Use a dockerfile as the `Image Type`.

. Use the drop-down menu to select your registry from the `Target Image Store` field.

. In the [guimenu]``Path`` field, type a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository URL.
The URL should be be http, https, or a token authentication URL.
Use one of these formats:

.GitHub Path Options
* GitHub single user project repository
+
----
https://github.com/USER/project.git#branchname:folder
----

* GitHub organization project repository
+
----
https://github.com/ORG/project.git#branchname:folder
----

* GitHub token authentication
+

If your git repository is private, modify the profile's URL to include authentication.
Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitHub token:
+

----
https://USER:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@github.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----

.GitLab Path Options
* GitLab single user project repository
+

----
https://gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----

* GitLab groups project repository
+

----
https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/project.git#master:/container/
----

* GitLab token authentication
+

If your git repository is private and not publicly accessible, you need to modify the profile's git URL to include authentication.
Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitLab token:
+

----
https://gitlab-ci-token:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
.Specifying a git branch
====
If a branch is not specified, the `master` branch will be used by default.
If a `folder` is not specified the image sources (dockerfile sources) are expected to be in the root directory of the GitHub or GitLab checkout.
====

. Select an `Activation Key`.
Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages.
+

.Relationship Between Activation Keys and Image Profiles
[NOTE]
====
When you associate an activation key with an image profile you are ensuring any image using the profile will use the correct software channel and any packages in the channel.
====

. Click the btn:[Create] button.



[[at.images.docker.sourceexample]]
.Example Dockerfile Sources


An Image Profile that can be reused is published at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles

[NOTE]
====
The [option]``ARG`` parameters ensure that the built image is associated with the desired repository version served by {productname}.
The [option]``ARG`` parameters also allow you to build image versions of {sles} which may differ from the version of {sles} used by the build host itself.

For example: The [comand]``ARG repo`` parameter and the [command]``echo`` command pointing to the repository file, creates and then injects the correct path into the repository file for the desired channel version.

The repository version is determined by the activation key that you assigned to your image profile.
====

[NOTE]
====
The [package]#python# and [package]#python-xml# packages must be installed in the container.
They are required for inspecting images, and for providing the package and product list of a container to the {productname} {webui}.
If you do not install them, images will still build but the package and product list will not available in the {webui}.

[[at.images.docker.building]]
=== Build an Image


There are two ways to build an image.
You can select menu:Images[Build] from the left navigation bar, or click the build icon in the menu:Images[Profiles] list.

image::images_image_build.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Building an Image
. Select menu:Images[Build].
. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default ``latest`` (only relevant to containers).
. Select [guimenu]``Build Profile`` and [guimenu]``Build Host``.
+

[NOTE]
.Profile Summary
====
Notice the [guimenu]``Profile Summary`` to the right of the build fields.
When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile will be displayed in this area.
====

. To schedule a build click the btn:[Build] button.



[[at.images.docker.importing]]
=== Import an Image


You can import and inspect arbitrary images.
Select menu:Images[Image List] from the left navigation bar.
Complete the text boxes of the [guimenu]``Import`` dialog.
When it has processed, the imported image will be listed on the [guimenu]``Image List`` page.

.Procedure: Importing an Image
. From menu:Images[Image list] click btn:[Import] to open the [guimenu]``Import Image`` dialog.
. In the [guimenu]``Import Image`` dialog complete these fields:
+

Image store:::
The registry from where the image will be pulled for inspection.

Image name:::
The name of the image in the registry.

Image version:::
The version of the image in the registry.

Build host:::
The build host that will pull and inspect the image.

Activation key:::
The activation key that provides the path to the software channel that the image will be inspected with.

. For confirmation, click btn:[Import].

The entry for the image is created in the database, and an ``Inspect Image`` action on {productname} is scheduled.

When it has been processed, you can find the imported image in the ``Image List``.
It has a different icon in the ``Build`` column, to indicate that the image is imported.
The status icon for the imported image can also be seen on the ``Overview`` tab for the image.



[[at.images.docker.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting


These are some known problems when working with images:

* HTTPS certificates to access the registry or the git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file.
* SSH git access using Docker is currently unsupported.
* If the [package]#python# and [package]#python-xml# packages are not installed in your images during the build process, reporting of installed packages or products will fail.
This will result in an ``unknown`` update status.



[[at.images.kiwi]]
== OS Images

OS Images are built by the Kiwi image system.
The output image is customizable and can be PXE, QCOW2, LiveCD, or other types of images.

For more information about the Kiwi build system, see the https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/[Kiwi documentation].



[[at.images.kiwi.requirements]]
=== Requirements

The Kiwi image building feature is available for Salt clients running {sles}{nbsp}12 and {sles}{nbsp}11.
//SLE15 images support is not yet released for SUMA4, will be part of SUMA4.0.4 as tech preview
//From {sles}{nbsp}15, ``kiwi-ng`` is used instead of the legacy Kiwi.

Kiwi image configuration files and configuration scripts must be accessible in one of these locations:

* Git repository
* HTTP hosted tarball
* Local build host directory

For an example of a complete Kiwi repository served by git, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage

[NOTE]
.Hardware Requirements for Hosts Running OS Images
====
Hosts running OS Images built with Kiwi need at least 1 GB of RAM.
Disk space depends on the actual size of the image.
For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system.
====

[WARNING]
====
The build host must be a Salt client.
Do not install the build host as a traditional client.
====


[[at.images.kiwi.buildhost]]
=== Create a Build Host


To build all kinds of images with {productname}, create and configure a build host.
OS Image build hosts are Salt clients running on {sles}{nbsp}12 (SP3 or later) or {sles}{nbsp}11 SP4.

This procedure will guide you through the initial configuration for a build host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image.

For example, build {sles}{nbsp}12 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}12 OS version.
Build {sles}{nbsp}11 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}11 OS version.
====


Configure the build host in the {productname} {webui}:

. Select a client that will be designated as a build host from the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
. Navigate to the menu:System Details[Properties] tab, enable the [guimenu]``Add-on System Type`` [guimenu]``OS Image Build Host``. Confirm with btn:[Update Properties].
+
image::os-image-build-host.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+
. Navigate to the menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels] tab, enable {productname} Client tools (for example: ``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool`` and ``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates``).
Schedule and click btn:[Confirm].
. Install Kiwi and all required packages by applying `Highstate`.
From the system details page select menu:States[Highstate] and click btn:[Apply Highstate].
Alternatively, apply Highstate from the {productname} Server command line:
+
----
salt '$your_client' state.highstate
----

.{productname} Web Server Public Certificate RPM
Build host provisioning copies the {productname} certificate RPM to the build host.
This certificate is used for accessing repositories provided by {productname}.

The certificate is packaged in RPM by the `mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage` package script.
The package script is called automatically during a new {productname} installation.

When you upgrade the `spacewalk-certs-tools` package, the upgrade scenario will call the package script using the default values.
However if the certificate path was changed or unavailable, you will need to call the package script manually using `--ca-cert-full-path <path_to_certificate>` after the upgrade procedure has finished.


.Package script call example
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
----

The RPM package with the certificate is stored in a salt-accessible directory such as `/usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm`.

The RPM package with the certificate is provided in the local build host repository `/var/lib/Kiwi/repo`.


[IMPORTANT]
.The RPM Package with the {productname} Certificate Must Be Specified in the Build Source
====
Make sure your build source Kiwi configuration contains `rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage` as a required package in the `bootstrap` section.

.config.xml
[source,xml]
----
...
  <packages type="bootstrap">
    ...
    <package name="rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage" bootinclude="true"/>
  </packages>
...
----
====



[[at.images.kiwi.buildchannels]]
=== Create an Activation Key for OS Images

Create an activation key associated with the channel that your OS Images will use as repositories when building the image.

Activation keys are mandatory for OS Image building.

[NOTE]
====
To build OS Images, you will need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than `SUSE Manager Default`.
====

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. In the {webui}, select menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key``.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Description``, a [guimenu]``Key`` name, and use the drop-down box to select a [guimenu]``Base Channel`` to associate with the key.
. Confirm with btn:[Create Activation Key].

For more information, see <<bp.key.managment>>.



[[at.images.kiwi.imagestore]]
=== Create an Image Store


OS Images can require a significant amount of storage space.
Therefore, we recommended that the OS Image store is located on a partition of its own or on a Btrfs subvolume, separate from the root partition.
By default, the image store will be located at [path]``/srv/www/os-images``.

[NOTE]
.Image Stores for Kiwi Build Type
====
Image stores for Kiwi build type, used to build system, virtual, and other images, are not supported yet.

Images are always stored in [path]``/srv/www/os-images/<organization id>`` and are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS [url]``https://<susemanager_host>/os-images/<organization id>``.
====



[[at.images.kiwi.profile]]
=== Create an Image Profile


Manage image profiles using the {webui}.

image::images_image_profiles.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Create an Image Profile
. To create an image profile select from menu:Images[Profiles] and click btn:[Create].
+

image::images_image_create_profile_kiwi.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, provide a name for the `Image Profile`.
. Use `Kiwi` as the [guimenu]``Image Type``.
. Image store is automatically selected.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Config URL`` to the directory containing the Kiwi configuration files:
.. git URI
.. HTTPS tarball
.. Path to build host local directory
. Select an [guimenu]``Activation Key``.
Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages.
+

[NOTE]
.Relationship Between Activation Keys and Image Profiles
====
When you associate activation key with an image profile you are ensuring any image using the profile will use the correct software channel and any packages in the channel.
====
+

. Confirm with the btn:[Create] button.


.Source format options
** git/HTTP(S) URL to the repository
+

URL to the git repository containing the sources of the image to be built.
Depending on the layout of the repository the URL can be:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles
----
+

You can specify a branch after the `#` character in the URL.
In this example, we use the `master` branch:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master
----
+

You can specify a directory that contains the image sources after the `:` character.
In this example, we use `OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6`:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6
----

** HTTP(S) URL to the tarball
+

URL to the tar archive, compressed or uncompressed, hosted on the webserver.
+
----
https://myimagesourceserver.example.org/MyKiwiImage.tar.gz
----

** Path to the directory on the build host
+

Enter the path to the directory with the Kiwi build system sources.
This directory must be present on the selected build host.
+

----
/var/lib/Kiwi/MyKiwiImage
----



[[at.images.kiwi.sourceexample]]
==== Example of Kiwi Sources


Kiwi sources consist at least of `config.xml`.
Usually, `config.sh` and `images.sh` are present as well.
Sources can also contain files to be installed in the final image under the `root` subdirectory.

For information about the Kiwi build system, see the https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/[Kiwi documentation].

{suse} provides examples of fully functional image sources at the https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles[SUSE/manager-build-profiles] public GitHub repository.

[[at.images.kiwi.building]]
=== Build an Image
// ianew: admin/image-management.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-27

There are two ways to build an image using the {webui}.
Either select menu:Images[Build], or click the build icon in the menu:Images[Profiles] list.

image::images_image_build.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Building an Image
. Select menu:Images[Build].
. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default ``latest`` (applies only to containers).
. Select the [guimenu]``Image Profile`` and a [guimenu]``Build Host``.
+

[NOTE]
.Profile Summary
====
A [guimenu]``Profile Summary`` is displayed to the right of the build fields.
When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile will show up in this area.
====
+

. To schedule a build, click the btn:[Build] button.



[[at.images.kiwi.inspection]]

After the image is successfully built, the inspection phase begins.
During the inspection phase {susemgr} collects information about the image:

* List of packages installed in the image
* Checksum of the image
* Image type and other image details

[NOTE]
====
If the built image type is `PXE`, a Salt pillar will also be generated.
Image pillars are stored in the `/srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/` directory and the Salt subsystem can access details about the generated image.
Details include where the pillar is located and provided, image checksums, information needed for network boot, and more.

The generated pillar is available to all connected clients.
====



[[at.images.kiwi.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting


Building an image requires of several dependent steps.
When the build fails, investigation of Salt states results can help you to identify the source of the failure.
Usual checks when the build fails:

* The build host can access the build sources
* There is enough disk space for the image on both the build host and the {productname} server
* The activation key has the correct channels associated with it
* The build sources used are valid
* The RPM package with the {productname} public certificate is up to date and available at `/usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm`.
For more on how to refresh a public certificate RPM, see <<at.images.kiwi.buildhost>>.



[[at.images.kiwi.limitations]]
=== Limitations

The section contains some known issues when working with images.

* HTTPS certificates used to access the HTTP sources or git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file, or configured manually.
* Importing Kiwi-based images is not supported.



[[at.images.listing]]
== List Image Profiles Available for Building


To list images available for building select menu:Images[Image List].
A list of all images will be displayed.

image::images_list_images.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Displayed data about images includes an image [guimenu]``Name``, its [guimenu]``Version`` and the build [guimenu]``Status``.
You will also see the image update status with a listing of possible patch and package updates that are available for the image.

Clicking the btn:[Details] button on an image will provide a detailed view.
The detailed view includes an exact list of relevant patches and a list of all packages installed within the image.

[NOTE]
====
The patch and the package list is only available if the inspect state after a build was successful.
====
