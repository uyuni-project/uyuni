@<client>
Feature: Create an activation key for <client>
  In order to register systems to the spacewalk server
  As the testing user
  I want to use activation keys

  Scenario: Create an activation key with the channel for a <client>
    Given I am on the Systems page
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > Activation Keys"
    And I follow "Create Key"
    And I enter "<client>_key" as "description"
    And I enter "<client>_key" as "key"
    And I select the base channel for the "<client>" from "selectedBaseChannel"
    And I check the custom channel for "<client>"
    And I include the recommended child channels
    And I select the contact method for the "<client>" from "contact-method"
    And I click on "Create Activation Key"
    And I scroll to the top of the page
    Then I should see a "Activation key <client>_key has been created" text
