Feature: IPMI Power management test for XMLRPC

  Scenario: Setup an IPMI host for XMLRPC test
    When the server starts mocking an IPMI host

  Scenario: Check the power management settings for XMLRPC test
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC powermgmt as user "admin" and password "admin"
    And I want to operate on this "sle_client"
    When I fetch power management values
    Then power management results should have "ipmitool" for "powerType"

  Scenario: Save power management values  for XMLRPC test
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC powermgmt as user "admin" and password "admin"
    And I want to operate on this "sle_client"
    When I set power management value "127.0.0.1" for "powerAddress"
    And I set power management value "ipmiusr" for "powerUsername"
    And I set power management value "test" for "powerPassword"
    And I set power management value "ipmitool" for "powerType"
    Then the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Address       : 127.0.0.1" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Username      : ipmiusr" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Password      : test" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Type          : ipmitool" for "sle_client"

  Scenario: Test IPMI functions for XMLRPC test
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC powermgmt as user "admin" and password "admin"
    And I want to operate on this "sle_client"
    When I turn power on
    Then the power status is "on"
    When I turn power off
    Then the power status is "off"
    When I do power management reboot
    Then the power status is "on"

  Scenario: Cleanup: reset IPMI values for XMLRPC test
    Given I am logged in via XML-RPC powermgmt as user "admin" and password "admin"
    And I want to operate on this "sle_client"
    When I set power management value "" for "powerAddress"
    And I set power management value "" for "powerUsername"
    And I set power management value "" for "powerPassword"
    Then the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Address       :" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Username      :" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Password      :" for "sle_client"
    And the cobbler report should contain "Power Management Type          : ipmitool" for "sle_client"

  Scenario: Cleanup: tear down the IPMI host for XMLRPC test
    When the server stops mocking an IPMI host
