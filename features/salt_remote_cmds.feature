  In Order to test the remote commands via salt
  As an authorized user
  I want to verify that the remote commands function works

  Scenario: Run a remote command
    And I am authorized as "testing" with password "testing"
    Given I follow "Salt"
    And I follow "Remote Commands"
    And I should see a "Remote Commands" text
    Then I enter command "ls -lha /etc"
    And I click on preview
    Then I should see my hostname
    And I click on run
    Then I wait for "3" seconds
    And I expand the results
    Then I should see "SuSE-release" in the command output
