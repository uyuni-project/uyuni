    When I enable the necessary repositories before installing Prometheus exporters on this "deblike_minion"

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Apply Prometheus exporter formulas on the Debian-like minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "deblike_minion"
    When I follow "Formulas" in the content area
    Then I should see a "Choose formulas:" text
    And I should see a "Monitoring" text
    When I check the "prometheus-exporters" formula
    And I click on "Save"
    And I wait until I see "Formula saved" text

  Scenario: Configure Prometheus exporter formula on the Debian-like minion
    When I follow "Formulas" in the content area
    And I follow "Prometheus Exporters" in the content area

    And I check "apache" exporter
    And I check "postgres" exporter
    And I click on "Save"
    Then I should see a "Formula saved" text

  Scenario: Apply highstate for Prometheus exporters on the Debian-like minion
    When I follow "States" in the content area
    And I click on "Apply Highstate"
    Then I should see a "Applying the highstate has been scheduled." text
    And I wait until event "Apply highstate scheduled by admin" is completed
