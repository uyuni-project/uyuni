  <h2>Clone Channel</h2>
    <div class="page-summary">

      <p>Select the channel you wish to clone from the list below.  You can clone a channel in one of three ways:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Current state of the channel
	     <p>The new channel will include all of the latest packages from the target channel, and all patches related to the channel will be cloned into your organization.  If your organization already owns a clone of a patch, the new channel will be associated with that patch instead of creating another clone of the patch.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Original state of the channel
	     <p>The new channel will be a clone of the original state of the target channel.  This is done by cloning all of the packages from the target channel which do not have a patch associated with them.  No patches will be cloned into your organization.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li>Select patches
	      <p>The original state of the target channel will be cloned into the new channel.  You will then have the option to select the patches you wish to import into the new channel.  Importing a patch will bring the packages from the target channel referred to by the patch into the new channel.  Selecting all of the patches from the list of potential patches is the same as cloning the current state of the channel.  Selecting none of the patches is the same as cloning the original state of the channel.</p>
	 </li>
       </ul>
