# Scalability configuration parameters

# This sets the number of salt-master worker processes.
# Raising this number allows the Salt master to cope with a higher number of
# slow-responding minions at the same time, but will also consume more main
# memory (typically 80 MB per worker).
#
# In general the default value should be sufficient, unless the following error
# appears in minion logs:
#
# Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. If this error persists after
# verifying the master is up, worker_threads may need to be increased
