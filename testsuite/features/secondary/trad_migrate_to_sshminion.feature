Feature: Migrate a traditional client into a Salt SSH minion
  In order to move away from traditional clients
  As an authorized user
  I want to migrate these clients to Salt SSH minions and have everything as before

  Scenario: Install a package before migration to Salt SSH minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_client"

    And I run "rhn_check -vvv" on "sle_client"
    Then I should see a "1 package install has been scheduled for" text
    When I wait until event "Package Install/Upgrade scheduled by admin" is completed
    Then "orion-dummy-1.1-1.1" should be installed on "sle_client"

  Scenario: Change contact method of activation key to ssh-push
    Given I am authorized as "admin" with password "admin"

    And I enter "22" as "port"
    And I enter "root" as "user"
    And I enter "linux" as "password"
    And I select "1-SUSE-PKG-x86_64" from "activationKeys"
    And I select the hostname of "proxy" from "proxies"
    And I check "manageWithSSH"
    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "Successfully bootstrapped host!" text

  Scenario: Check that the migrated system is now a SSH minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_migrated_minion"
    When I wait until I see the name of "sle_migrated_minion", refreshing the page
    And I follow "Properties" in the content area
    Then I wait until I see "Base System Type:     Salt" text, refreshing the page

@proxy

    Then I should see "sle_migrated_minion" hostname

  # bsc#1020902 - moving from traditional to Salt with bootstrap is not disabling rhnsd
  Scenario: Check that service nhsd has been stopped on migrated SSH minion
    When I run "systemctl status nhsd" on "sle_migrated_minion" without error control
    Then the command should fail

  # bsc#1031081 - old and new activation keys shown for the migrated client
  Scenario: Check that SSH minion only has the new activation key
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_migrated_minion"
    Then I should see a "Activation Key:	1-SUSE-PKG-x86_64" text
