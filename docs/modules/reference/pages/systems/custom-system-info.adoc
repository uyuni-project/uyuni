Unlike with notes, the information here is more formal and can be searched.
For example, you may decide to specify an asset tag for each system.
To do so, select [guimenu]``Custom System Info`` from the left navigation bar and create an `asset` key.

Click [guimenu]``Create Key`` in the upper-right corner of the page.
Enter a suitable label and description, such as `Asset` and ``Precise location of each system``, then click btn:[Create Key].
The key will show up in the custom info keys list.

When the key exists, you may assign a value to it through the [guimenu]``Custom Info`` tab of the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.
For more on custom system information, see xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-custom-info.adoc[].
