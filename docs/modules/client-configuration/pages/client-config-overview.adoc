= Introduction

Registering clients is the first step after installing {productname}, and most of the time you spend with {productname} will be spent on maintaining those clients.

{productname} is compatible with a range of client technologies: you can install traditional or Salt clients, running {sle} or another Linux operating system, with a range of hardware options.

For a complete list of supported clients and features, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

This guide discusses how to register and configure different clients, both manually and automatically.
