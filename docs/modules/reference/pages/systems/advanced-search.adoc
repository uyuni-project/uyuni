= Advanced Search

Carry out an [guimenu]``Advanced Search`` on your systems according to the following criteria: network info, hardware devices, location, activity, packages, details, DMI info, and hardware.

Refine searches using the [guimenu]``Field to Search`` drop-down box, which is set to [guimenu]``Name/Description`` by default.

The Activity selections ([guimenu]``Days Since Last Check-in``, for example) are useful in finding and removing outdated system profiles.

Type the keyword, select the criterion to search by, use the radio buttons to specify whether you want to query all systems or only those in the [guimenu]``System Set Manager``, and click the btn:[Search] button.
To list all systems that do _not_ match the criteria, select the [guimenu]``Invert Result`` check box.

The results appear at the bottom of the page.
For more on how to use the system list, see xref:reference:systems/systems-list.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
If you add a distribution, newly synchronize channels, or register a system with a {productname} server, it may take several minutes for it to be indexed and appear in search results.
To force the rebuild of the search index, enter [command]``rhn-search cleanindex`` on the command line and wait until the rebuild is finished.
