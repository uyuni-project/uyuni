Feature: Configure groups and saltboot formula for terminals
  In order to use SUSE Manager for Retail solution
  As the system administrator
  I configure groups and saltboot formulas for all types of terminals

  Scenario: Apply configured formulas via the highstate
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "proxy"
    When I follow "States" in the content area
    And I enable repositories before installing branch server
    And I click on "Apply Highstate"
    And I wait until event "Apply highstate scheduled by admin" is completed
    And I disable repositories after installing branch server

  Scenario: Create hardware type group for SLES 15 SP2 terminals
    Given I am on the groups page
    When I follow "Create Group"
    And I enter "HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine15" as "name"
    And I enter "Terminal hardware type: genuine Intel15" as "description"
    And I click on "Create Group"
    Then I should see a "System group HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine15 created." text

  Scenario: Create hardware type group for SLES 12 SP4 terminals
    Given I am on the groups page
    When I follow "Create Group"
    And I enter "HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine12" as "name"
    And I enter "Terminal hardware type: genuine Intel12" as "description"
    And I click on "Create Group"
    Then I should see a "System group HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine12 created." text

  Scenario: Create hardware type group for SLES 11 SP3 terminals
    Given I am on the groups page
    When I follow "Create Group"
    And I enter "HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine11" as "name"
    And I enter "Terminal hardware type: genuine Intel11" as "description"
    And I click on "Create Group"
    Then I should see a "System group HWTYPE:Intel-Genuine11 created." text

  Scenario: Create terminal branch group for terminals
    Given I am on the groups page
    When I follow "Create Group"
