Feature: Use salt formulas
  In order to use simple forms to apply changes to minions
  As an authorized user
  I want to be able to install and use salt formulas

  Scenario: Install a formula package on the server
     Given I am authorized
     When I manually install the "locale" formula on the server
     And I reload the page
     And I follow "Salt"
     And I follow "Formula Catalog"
     Then I should see a "locale" text

  Scenario: Enable the formula on the minion
     Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
     When I follow "Formula Catalog" in the content area
     And I follow "Formulas" in the content area
     Then I should see a "Choose formulas:" text
     When I check the "locale" formula
     And I click on "Save"
     Then the "locale" formula should be checked

  Scenario: Parametrize the formula on the minion
     Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
     When I follow "Formula Catalog" in the content area
     And I follow "Locale" in the content area
     And I select "Etc/GMT-5" in timezone name field
     And I select "French" in language field
     And I select "French (Canada)" in keyboard layout field
     And I click on "Save Formula"
     Then I should see a "Formula saved!" text

  Scenario: Apply the formula via the highstate
     Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-minion"
     When I follow "Formula Catalog" in the content area
     And I follow "Formulas" in the content area
     And I click on "Apply Highstate"
     Then I should see a "Applying the highstate has been scheduled." text
     And I wait for "5" seconds
     ### following test always fails because of salt states left by sumaform
     # And the timezone on "sle-minion" should be "+05"
     ### disabling temporarily
     And the keymap on "sle-minion" should be "ca.map.gz"
     And the language on "sle-minion" should be "fr_FR.UTF-8"

  Scenario: Check the pillar data
     When I refresh the pillar data
     Then the pillar data for "timezone:name" should be "Etc/GMT-5"
     And the pillar data for "keyboard_and_language:keyboard_layout" should be "French (Canada)"
     And the pillar data for "keyboard_and_language:language" should be "French"
