TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT
PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND YOU SHOULD NOTIFY THE

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between You

the terms of this Agreement.  If the laws of Your principal place of business
require contracts to be in the local language to be enforceable, such local
language version may be obtained from Licensor upon written request and shall be
deemed to govern Your purchase of licenses to the Software.  Any add-on,
extension, update, mobile application, module, adapter or support release to the
Software that You may download or receive that is not accompanied by a license
agreement is Software and is governed by this Agreement.  If the Software is an
update or support release, then You must have validly licensed the version and
quantity of the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use
the update or support release.

LICENSED USE

LICENSES.  The Software and each of its components are owned by Licensor or
other licensors and are protected under copyright laws and other applicable
laws. Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Licensor grants to You a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide
license to reproduce and use copies of the Software within Your Organization (as

You may be subject, under any applicable open source licenses to any open source
code contained in the Software.  The Software may include or be bundled with
other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by a
third party other than Licensor.  Use of any software programs accompanied by a
separate license agreement is governed by that separate license agreement.

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.  Licensor has no obligation to provide maintenance or
