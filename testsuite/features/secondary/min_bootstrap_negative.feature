Feature: Negative tests for bootstrapping normal minions
  In order to register only valid minions 
  As an authorized user
  I want to avoid registration with invalid input parameters

  Scenario: Bootstrap should fail when minion already exists
     Given I am authorized
     And I go to the bootstrapping page

     And I enter "root" as "user"
     And I enter "linux" as "password"
     And I click on "Bootstrap"

     And I should see a "seems to already exist, please check!" text

  Scenario: Delete SLES minion system profile before bootstrap negative tests
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"

     And I enter "root" as "user"
     And I enter "linux" as "password"
