# Configuration

Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services` file if you need to add more options to the `podman` pod running command.

Copy the content of the proxy configuration generated by the server in `/etc/uyuni/proxy` folder.

# Starting the containers

Just start the `uyuni-proxy-pod.service` systemd service.

# Required volumes

In order to persist the caches and tftp boot files, the pod uses volumes.
Those are automatically created when the containers are started, but you can create and populate them in advance.
The volume names are:

* uyuni-proxy-squid-cache
* uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache
* uyuni-proxy-tftpboot

See the `podman-volume-create` and `podman-volume-import` man pages for more information on how to create custom volumes.

# Getting logs

You can get logs from the `uyuni-poxy-*` services using `journalctl`.
You can also use `podman logs` using the same names.
