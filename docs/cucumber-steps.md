### Basic notions

We use "targets" in the Ruby code to encapsulate the notion of testing hosts.
The corresponding notion in cucumber steps is "step host names".

Possible values are currently:

| Test host | Ruby target |  Bash environment variable | Step host name | Sumaform module |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| SUSE Manager server | ```$server``` | ```$TESTHOST``` |  | ```"suse_manager"``` |
| SUSE Manager proxy | ```$proxy``` | ```$PROXY``` | ```"proxy"``` | ```"suse_manager_proxy"``` |
| SLES traditional client | ```$client``` | ```$CLIENT``` | ```"sle-client"``` | ```"client"``` |
| SLES Salt minion | ```$minion``` | ```$MINION``` | ```"sle-minion"``` or ```"sle-migrated-minion"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| SLES Salt SSH minion | ```$ssh_minion``` | ```$SSHMINION``` | ```"ssh-minion"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| Cent OS Salt minion or traditional client | ```$ceos_minion``` | ```$CENTOSMINION``` | ```"ceos-minion"``` (no ```"ceos-client"``` ATM) | ```"minion"``` |

These names are such for historical reasons and might be made better in the future.

### Reusing old steps

These are only the most important generic steps. For more specialized steps,
please grep in the source code.


<a name="b1" />

#### Logging in and out

* Go to the login page

```cucumber
  When I go to the home page
```

* Sign in as user "testing" with password "testing"

```cucumber
  Given I am authorized
```

* Sign in as a given user with given password

```cucumber
  Given I am authorized as "admin" with password "admin"
```

* Check we are signed in

```cucumber
  Then I should be logged in
```

To check for the initial log in, prefer ```Then I am logged in```.

* Sign out

```cucumber
  Given I sign out
```

* Check we are signed out

```cucumber
  Then I should not be authorized
```

#### Navigating through pages

* Go to a given page through a link

```cucumber
  When I follow "Salt"
```

* Go to Admin => Setup Wizard

```cucumber
  When I am on the Admin page
```

* Go to Admin => Organizations

```cucumber
  When I am on the Organizations page
```

* Go to Home => User Account => Credentials

```cucumber
  When I am on the Credentials page
```

* Go to Patches => Patches => Relevant

```cucumber
  When I am on the patches page
```

* Go to Salt => Keys

```cucumber
  When I go to the minion onboarding page
```

* Go to Systems => Overview

```cucumber
  When I am on the System Overview page
```

* Go to Systems => Autoinstallation => Overview

```cucumber
  When I am on Autoinstallation Overview page
```

* Go to Systems => Autoinstallation => Profiles => Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File

```cucumber
  When I am on the Create Autoinstallation Profile page
```

* Go to Systems => Bootstrapping

```cucumber
  When I go to the bootstrapping page
```

* Go to Systems => Systems

```cucumber
  When I click Systems, under Systems node
```

* Go to Systems => System Groups

```cucumber
  When I am on the groups page
```

* Go to Systems => System Set Manager

```cucumber
  When I am on the System Manager System Overview page
```

* Go to Systems => System Set Manager => Overview

```cucumber
  When I am on System Set Manager Overview
```

* Go to Users => Users list => Active

```cucumber
  When I am on the Active Users page
```

* Go to details of a given client

```cucumber
  When I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle-client"
```

```cucumber
  When I reload the page
```

<a name="b3" />

#### Texts

* Check for a given text

```cucumber
  Then I should see a "System Overview" text
  Then I should not see a "[Management]" text
  Then I should see a "Keys" text in the content area
  Then I should see "sle-minion" hostname
  Then I should not see "sle-minion" hostname
```

For a test with a regular expression, there is ```I should see a text like "..."```

* Same, but wait until text appears

```cucumber
  Then I wait until I see "Successfully bootstrapped host! " text
```

* Same, but re-issue HTTP requests to refresh the page

```cucumber
  When I wait until I see "Software Updates Available" text, refreshing the page
  When I try to reload page until contains "OpenSCAP xccdf scanning" text

```

The button can be identified by id, value, title, text content, or alt of image.
If several buttons have been found, this step picks the first one.

* Click on a given radio button

```cucumber
  When I check radio button "schedule-by-action-chain"
  When I choose ";"
```

The radio button can be identified by name, id or label text.

(will be unified)

  When I check the row with the "suse_docker_admin" text
  When I check "New Test Channel" in the list
  When I uncheck "hoag-dummy-1.1-2.1" in the list
```

(will be unified)

* Make sure a checkbox is checked or not

```cucumber
  Then I should see "metadataSigned" as checked

```

* Type text in the text editor

```cucumber
  When I enter "MGR_PROXY=yes" in the editor
```


<a name="b7" />

#### Operating system

* Run an arbitrary command and expect it to succeed

```cucumber
  When I run "rhn_check -vvv" on "sle-client"
```

  When I remove pkg "orion-dummy" on this "sle-minion"
  When I manually remove the "milkyway-dummy" package in the minion
  When I wait for "virgo-dummy-1.0" to be installed on this "sle-minion"
  Then "man" is installed on "sle-client"
  Then "milkyway-dummy" is not installed
```

(some of these will get unified)

* Services

```cucumber
  When I shutdown the spacewalk service
  When I restart the spacewalk service
  When I wait until "salt-minion" service is up and running on "ceos-minion"
```

* Files

```cucumber
  When I fetch "pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-test.sh" to "sle-client"
  When I remove "/root/foobar" from "sle-minion"
  Then "/root/foobar" exists on the filesystem of "sle-minion"
  Then file "/srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default" exists on server
  Then file "/srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default" contains "kernel_option=a_value"
  When I get the contents of the remote file "/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf"
  Then it should contain a "rest_cherrypy:" text
```

(last ones could be unified)

* Calling various XML-RPC methods

For example:

```cucumber
  When I call actionchain.add_package_install()
```

### Writing new steps

Here we describe only the specificities of this testsuite. For a description
of the underlying libraries, have a look at
[Capybara documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara).


#### Running remote commands

When implementing a step, to run a command on a target, use:

```ruby
$server.run("uptime")
$client.run("uptime", false)
$minion.run("uptime", true)
$minion.run("uptime", true, 300)
$client.run("uptime", false, 500, "root")
```

Arguments taken by method ```run``` are:

1. command to execute on the target system.
2. true/false, by **default** is ```true```. If the return code of the command is nonzero, then we raise an error and make the test fail. Sometimes, we expect that a command fails, or sometimes, it is not relevant whether it succeeded, so we use ```false``` in such cases.
3. timeout : **default** is 200. You can increase/decrease the timeout. You may want to use a smaller timeout, but retry several times until ```DEFAULT_TIMEOUT```.
4. user : **default** is root. It's the user that executes the command.


#### Getting the FQDN of a host

When implementing a step, to get the FQDN of the host, use:

```ruby
  STDOUT puts $client.full_hostname
```

#### Converting between host name and target

When implementing a step, to convert a step host name into a target, use:

```ruby
  node = get_target(target)
```
