Feature: Install a package to the client

  Scenario: Install a package to the client
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this client
    And metadata generation finished for "sles11-sp3-updates-x86_64-channel"
    And I follow "Software" in the content area
    And I follow "Install"
    When I check "hoag-dummy-1.1-2.1" in the list
    And I click on "Install Selected Packages"
    And I click on "Confirm"
    And I run rhn_check on this client
    Then I should see a "1 package install has been scheduled for" text
    And "hoag-dummy-1.1-2.1" is installed on "client"
