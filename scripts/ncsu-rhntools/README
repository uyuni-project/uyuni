RHN Tools
=========

These are a collection of tools I've written or hacked together to
help maintain NCSU's Red Hat Satellite.  Each file has a description about
what it does.

Contents:

The rhnstats/ directory contains code that generates a web page, CSV,
and raw SQLite database with some RHN statistics about where machines
are grouped.  Useful for keeping a generated web page for the accountants.

findpackages.py - Runs on a Satellite and will use data from the RHN
API to build package trees for each channel.

getRealmHosts.py - Example script.  Creates a list of hosts in RHN to
be used with subscribeRHN.py.

subscribeRHN.py - Re-subscribe machines in RHN to needed sub-channels
when the RHN contract expires or whathaveyou.

groupSummary.py - Displays a summary of the RHN groups and ungrouped
machines.

oldSystems.py - Delete registrations that have been inactive for X
days.

rhnapi.py, config.py - Helper modules.
