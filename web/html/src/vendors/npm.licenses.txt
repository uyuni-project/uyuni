2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

##Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions, including new icons, without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

## Versions

| react-select | react-select-async-paginate |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 4.x | 0.5.x |
| 3.x | 0.5.x, 0.4.x, ^0.3.2 |
| 2.x | 0.3.x, 0.2.x |
| 1.x | 0.1.x |

## Installation

```
npm install react-select react-select-async-paginate
```

or

```
yarn add react-select react-select-async-paginate
```

## Usage

`AsyncPaginate` is an alternative of `Async` but supports loading page by page. It is wrapper above default `react-select` thus it accepts all props of default `Select` except `isLoading`. And there are some new props:

### loadOptions

Required. Async function that take next arguments:

1. Current value of search input.
2. Loaded options for current search.
3. Collected additional data e.g. current page number etc. For first load it is `additional` from props, for next is `additional` from previous response for current search. `null` by default.

It should return next object:

```
{
  options: Array,
  hasMore: boolean,
  additional?: any,
}
```

It similar to `loadOptions` from `Select.Async` but there is some differences:

1. Loaded options as 2nd argument.
2. Additional data as 3nd argument.
3. Not supports callback.
4. Should return `hasMore` for detect end of options list for current search.

### debounceTimeout

Not required. Number. Debounce timeout for `loadOptions` calls. `0` by default.

### additional

Not required. Default `additional` for first request for every search.

### defaultAdditional

Not required. Default `additional` for empty search if `options` or `defaultOptions` defined.

### shouldLoadMore

Not required. Function. By default new options will load only after scroll menu to bottom. Arguments:

- scrollHeight
- clientHeight
- scrollTop

Should return boolean.

### reduceOptions

Not required. Function. By default new loaded options are concat with previous. Arguments:

- previous options
- loaded options
- next additional

Should return new options.

### cacheUniqs

Not required. Array. Works as 2nd argument of `useEffect` hook. When one of items changed, `AsyncPaginate` cleans all cached options.

### loadOptionsOnMenuOpen

Not required. Boolean. If `false` options will not load on menu opening.

### selectRef

Ref for take `react-select` instance.

## Example

### offset way

```javascript
import { AsyncPaginate } from 'react-select-async-paginate';

...

/*
 * assuming the API returns something like this:
 *   const json = {
 *     results: [
 *       {
 *         value: 1,
 *         label: 'Audi',
 *       },
 *       {
 *         value: 2,
 *         label: 'Mercedes',
 *       },
 *       {
 *         value: 3,
 *         label: 'BMW',
 *       },
 *     ],
 *     has_more: true,
 *   };
 */

async function loadOptions(search, loadedOptions) {
  const response = await fetch(`/awesome-api-url/?search=${search}&offset=${loadedOptions.length}`);
  const responseJSON = await response.json();

  return {
    options: responseJSON.results,
    hasMore: responseJSON.has_more,
  };
}

<AsyncPaginate
  value={value}
  loadOptions={loadOptions}
  onChange={setValue}
/>
```

### page way

```javascript
import { AsyncPaginate } from 'react-select-async-paginate';

...

async function loadOptions(search, loadedOptions, { page }) {
  const response = await fetch(`/awesome-api-url/?search=${search}&page=${page}`);
  const responseJSON = await response.json();

  return {
    options: responseJSON.results,
    hasMore: responseJSON.has_more,
    additional: {
      page: page + 1,
    },
  };
}

<AsyncPaginate
  value={value}
  loadOptions={loadOptions}
  onChange={setValue}
  additional={{
    page: 1,
  }}
/>
```

## Grouped options

You can use `reduceGroupedOptions` util to group options by `label` key.

```javascript
import { AsyncPaginate, reduceGroupedOptions } from 'react-select-async-paginate';

/*
 * assuming the API returns something like this:
 *   const json = {
 *     options: [
 *       label: 'Cars',
 *       options: [
 *         {
 *           value: 1,
 *           label: 'Audi',
 *         },
 *         {
 *           value: 2,
 *           label: 'Mercedes',
 *         },
 *         {
 *           value: 3,
 *           label: 'BMW',
 *         },
 *       ]
 *     ],
 *     hasMore: true,
 *   };
 */

...

<AsyncPaginate
  {...otherProps}
  reduceOptions={reduceGroupedOptions}
/>
```

## Replacing react-select component

You can use `withAsyncPaginate` HOC.

```javascript
import { withAsyncPaginate } from 'react-select-async-paginate';

...

const CustomAsyncPaginate = withAsyncPaginate(CustomSelect);
```

### typescript

Describing type of component with extra props (example with `Creatable`):

```typescript
import type { ReactElement } from 'react';
import type { GroupBase } from 'react-select';
import Creatable from 'react-select/creatable';
import type { CreatableProps } from 'react-select/creatable';

import { withAsyncPaginate } from 'react-select-async-paginate';
import type {
  UseAsyncPaginateParams,
  ComponentProps,
} from 'react-select-async-paginate';

type AsyncPaginateCreatableProps<
OptionType,
Group extends GroupBase<OptionType>,
Additional,
IsMulti extends boolean,
> =
  & CreatableProps<OptionType, IsMulti, Group>
  & UseAsyncPaginateParams<OptionType, Group, Additional>
  & ComponentProps<OptionType, Group, IsMulti>;

type AsyncPaginateCreatableType = <
OptionType,
Group extends GroupBase<OptionType>,
Additional,
IsMulti extends boolean = false,
>(props: AsyncPaginateCreatableProps<OptionType, Group, Additional, IsMulti>) => ReactElement;

const AsyncPaginateCreatable = withAsyncPaginate(Creatable) as AsyncPaginateCreatableType;
```

## Replacing Components

Usage of replacing components is similar with `react-select`, but there is one difference. If you redefine `MenuList` you should wrap it with `wrapMenuList` for workaround of some internal bugs of `react-select`.

```javascript
import { AsyncPaginate, wrapMenuList } from 'react-select-async-paginate';

...

const MenuList = wrapMenuList(CustomMenuList);

<AsyncPaginate
  {...otherProps}
  components={{
    ...otherComponents,
    MenuList,
  }}
/>
```

## Extended usage

If you want construct own component that uses logic of `react-select-async-paginate` inside, you can use next hooks:

- `useAsyncPaginate`
- `useAsyncPaginateBase`
- `useComponents`

```javascript
import {
  useAsyncPaginate,
  useComponents,
} from 'react-select-async-paginate';

...

const CustomAsyncPaginateComponent = ({
  options,
  defaultOptions,
  additional,
  loadOptionsOnMenuOpen,
  debounceTimeout,
  filterOption,
  reduceOptions,
  shouldLoadMore,

  components: defaultComponents,

  value,
  onChange,
}) => {
  const asyncPaginateProps = useAsyncPaginate({
    options,
    defaultOptions,
    additional,
    loadOptionsOnMenuOpen,
    debounceTimeout,
    filterOption,
    reduceOptions,
    shouldLoadMore,
  });

  const components = useComponents(defaultComponents);

  return (
    <CustomSelect
      {...asyncPaginateProps}
      components={components}
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

`useComponents` provides redefined `MenuList` component by default. If you want redefine it, you should also wrap in with `wrapMenuList`.

# React-Select

The Select control for [React](https://reactjs.com). Initially built for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).

See [react-select.com](https://www.react-select.com) for live demos and comprehensive docs.

See our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3585) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v2 to v3.

React Select is funded by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au) and [Atlassian](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com). It represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that _just work_ out of the box, while being extremely customisable.

Features include:

- Flexible approach to data, with customisable functions
- Extensible styling API with [emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- Component Injection API for complete control over the UI behaviour
- Controllable state props and modular architecture
- Long-requested features like option groups, portal support, animation, and more

If you're interested in the background, watch Jed's [talk on React Select](https://youtu.be/Eb2wy-HNGMo) at ReactNYC in March 2018.

See our [upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade-guide) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v1 to v2.

The old docs and examples will continue to be available at [v1.react-select.com](https://v1.react-select.com).

# Installation and usage

The easiest way to use react-select is to install it from npm and build it into your app with Webpack.

```
yarn add react-select
```

Then use it in your app:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Select from 'react-select';

const options = [
  { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
  { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
  { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' },
];

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedOption: null,
  };
  handleChange = selectedOption => {
    this.setState({ selectedOption });
    console.log(`Option selected:`, selectedOption);
  };
  render() {
    const { selectedOption } = this.state;

    return (
      <Select
        value={selectedOption}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        options={options}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

## Props

Common props you may want to specify include:

- `autoFocus` - focus the control when it mounts
- `className` - apply a className to the control
- `classNamePrefix` - apply classNames to inner elements with the given prefix
- `isDisabled` - disable the control
- `isMulti` - allow the user to select multiple values
- `isSearchable` - allow the user to search for matching options
- `name` - generate an HTML input with this name, containing the current value
- `onChange` - subscribe to change events
- `options` - specify the options the user can select from
- `placeholder` - change the text displayed when no option is selected
- `value` - control the current value

See the [props documentation](https://www.react-select.com/props) for complete documentation on the props react-select supports.

## Controllable Props

You can control the following props by providing values for them. If you don't, react-select will manage them for you.

- `value` / `onChange` - specify the current value of the control
- `menuIsOpen` / `onMenuOpen` / `onMenuClose` - control whether the menu is open
- `inputValue` / `onInputChange` - control the value of the search input (changing this will update the available options)

If you don't provide these props, you can set the initial value of the state they control:

- `defaultValue` - set the initial value of the control
- `defaultMenuIsOpen` - set the initial open value of the menu
- `defaultInputValue` - set the initial value of the search input

## Methods

React-select exposes two public methods:

- `focus()` - focus the control programatically
- `blur()` - blur the control programatically

## Customisation

Check the docs for more information on:

- [Customising the styles](https://www.react-select.com/styles)
- [Using custom components](https://www.react-select.com/components)
- [Using the built-in animated components](https://www.react-select.com/home#animated-components)

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

sort-package-json@2.2.0 - Keith Cirkel <npm@keithcirkel.co.uk>
https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sort Package.json

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keithamus/sort-package-json.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/keithamus/sort-package-json)

## CLI

### Run via npx (npm@5.2+ required)

```bash
npx sort-package-json
```

### Install

```bash
npm install --global sort-package-json
```

### Usage

```bash
$ cd my-project
$ cat package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sort-package-json": "1.0.0",
    "sort-object-keys": "1.0.0"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "my-awesome-project"
}

$ npx sort-package-json
package.json is sorted!

$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "sort-object-keys": "1.0.0",
    "sort-package-json": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

CLI also supports multi file paths or [`glob`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby) - so you can give it a bunch of `package.json` file(s) to sort.

```bash
$ sort-package-json "my-package/package.json" "other-package/package.json"

$ sort-package-json "package.json" "packages/*/package.json"
```

#### `--check` flag

When you want to check if your files are sorted, you can run CLI with the `--check` flag (or `-c`). This will output a list of not sorted files, if any.

```bash
$ sort-package-json "**/package.json" --check

# 5 matched files are sorted.


$ sort-package-json "**/package.json" --check
# foo/package.json
# bar/package.json

# 2 of 5 matched files are not sorted.
```

## API

### Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev sort-package-json
```

### Usage

```js
sortPackageJson(packageJson, options?)
```

Pass a JSON string, return a new sorted JSON string.\
Pass a JSON object, return a new sorted JSON object.

```js
import sortPackageJson from 'sort-package-json'

const packageJsonString = `{
  "dependencies": {
    "sort-package-json": "1.0.0",
    "sort-object-keys": "1.0.0"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "my-awesome-project"
}`

console.log(sortPackageJson(packageJsonString))
/* => string:
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "sort-object-keys": "1.0.0",
    "sort-package-json": "1.0.0"
  }
}
*/

const packageJsonObject = JSON.parse(packageJsonString)
console.log(sortPackageJson(packageJsonObject))
/* => object:
{
  name: 'my-awesome-project',
  version: '1.0.0',
  dependencies: {
    'sort-object-keys': '1.0.0',
    'sort-package-json': '1.0.0'
  }
}
*/
```

#### options.sortOrder

Type: `string[] | Function`\
Default: `sortPackageJson.sortOrder`

Custom ordering array or comparator function.

If an array, sort keys in ordering of `options.sortOrder`.

**Notice**: fields not in this array, will still sort by `defaultSortOrder`

```js
const sorted = sortPackageJson(packageJsonObject, {
  sortOrder: ['version']
})

console.log(Object.keys(sorted))

// -> [ 'version', 'name', 'dependencies' ]
//                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                 `name` and `dependencies` are sorted by defaultSortOrder
```

If a function, sort fields by [Array#sort(options.sortOrder)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Description)

```js
const sorted = sortPackageJson(packageJsonObject, {
  sortOrder(left, right) {
    return left.localeCompare(right)
  }
})

console.log(Object.keys(sorted))

// -> [ 'dependencies', 'name', 'version' ]
```

## Automatically Sort

The package.json file can be sorted automatically before committing, install `husky` and `lint-staged` and add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "package.json": "sort-package-json"
  }
}
```

## PFAQ: Potential Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it sort?

It sorts using [`sort-object-keys`](http://github.com/keithamus/sort-object-keys). It sorts using the well-known keys of a package.json. For the full list check the [default rules](./defaultRules.md). It sorts sub-keys too - sometimes by a well-known order, other times alphabetically. The initial order was derived from the [package.json docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) with a few extras added for good measure.

### It doesn't sort X?

Cool. Send a PR! It might get denied if it is a specific vendor key of an unpopular project (e.g. `"my-super-unknown-project"`). We sort keys like "browserify" because it is a project with millions of users. If your project has, say, over 100 users, then we'll add it. Sound fair?

### Isn't this just like Project X?

Could be. I wanted this one because at the time of writing, nothing is:

- Zero config
- Able to be used in a library
- Quiet (i.e. not spitting out annoying log messages, when used in a library mode)

### I would like this tool to be configurable with a config file or command line arguments.

The lack of configuration here is a feature, not a bug. The intent of this tool is that a user can open a package json and always expect to see keys in a particular order. If we add a configuration for this tool, then that promise is broken, as users will first need to look at the configuration for each project to learn the ways in which this tool will change the `package.json`. The structure of the `package.json` should always be predictable & deterministic from project to project. I think the _reason_ why this project is well used is because it is not another "tool" you have to set up with yet another JSON file and more cruft in your project to support it. You run a command and it does what it says on the tin.

A lot of people who ask for configuration cite the use case that they simply don't like the given order that exists and want to make sweeping changes. To me this seems far better suited to simply making a fork of this project as then you can go far further than specifying configuration.

### What?! Why would you want to do this?!

Well, it's nice to have the keys of a package.json in a well sorted order. Almost everyone would agree having "name" at the top of a package.json is sensible (rather than sorted alphabetically or somewhere silly like the bottom), so why not the rest of the package.json?

Timepicker Plugin for jQuery
========================

[<img src="http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker/lib/screenshot.png" alt="timepicker screenshot" />](http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker)

[See a demo and examples here](http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker)

jquery.timepicker is a lightweight timepicker plugin for jQuery inspired by Google Calendar. It supports both mouse and keyboard navigation, and weighs in at 2.7kb minified and gzipped.

Requirements
------------
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7)

Usage
-----

```javascript
$('.some-time-inputs').timepicker(options);
```

Include `jquery.timepicker.css` and `jquery.timepicker.min.js` in your page.

```options``` is an optional javascript object with parameters explained below.

You can also set options as [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) on the intput elements, like ```<input type="text" data-time-format="H:i:s" />```. Timepicker still needs to be initialized by calling ```$('#someElement').timepicker(options);```. Data attributes will override any conflicting initialization options.

The defaults for all options are exposed through the ```$.fn.timepicker.defaults``` object. Properties changed in this object (same properties configurable through the constructor) will take effect for every instance created after the change.

Options
-------

- **appendTo**  
Override where the dropdown is appended.  
Takes either a `string` to use as a selector, a `function` that gets passed the clicked input element as argument or a jquery `object` to use directly.  
*default: "body"*

- **className**  
A class name to apply to the HTML element that contains the timepicker dropdown.  
*default: null*

- **closeOnWindowScroll**  
Close the timepicker when the window is scrolled. (Replicates ```<select>``` behavior.)  
*default: false*

- **disableTimeRanges**  
Disable selection of certain time ranges. Input is an array of time pairs, like ```[['3:00am', '4:30am'], ['5:00pm', '8:00pm']]```. The start of the interval will be disabled but the end won't.
*default: []*

- **disableTextInput**  
Disable typing in the timepicker input box; force users to select from list. [More information here.](https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker/issues/425#issuecomment-133262458)  
*default: false*

- **disableTouchKeyboard**  
Disable the onscreen keyboard for touch devices. There can be instances where Firefox or Chrome have touch events enabled (such as on Surface tablets but not actually be a touch device. In this case `disableTouchKeyboard` will prevent the timepicker input field from being focused. [More information here.](https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker/issues/413)  
*default: false*

- **durationTime**  
The time against which ```showDuration``` will compute relative times. If this is a function, its result will be used.  
*default: minTime*

- **forceRoundTime**  
Force update the time to ```step``` settings as soon as it loses focus.  
*default: false*

- **lang**  
Language constants used in the timepicker. Can override the defaults by passing an object with one or more of the following properties: decimal, mins, hr, hrs.  
*default:* ```{
	am: 'am',
	pm: 'pm',
	AM: 'AM',
	PM: 'PM',
	decimal: '.',
	mins: 'mins',
	hr: 'hr',
	hrs: 'hrs'
}```

- **maxTime**  
The time that should appear last in the dropdown list. Can be used to limit the range of time options.  
*default: 24 hours after minTime*

- **minTime**  
The time that should appear first in the dropdown list.  
*default: 12:00am*

- **noneOption**  
Adds one or more custom options to the top of the dropdown. Can accept several different value types:  
Boolean (```true```): Adds a "None" option that results in an empty input value  
String: Adds an option with a custom label that results in an empty input value  
Object: Similar to string, but allows customizing the element's class name and the resulting input value. Can contain ```label```, ```value```, and ```className``` properties. ```value``` must be a string type.  
Array: An array of strings or objects to add multiple non-time options  
*default: false*

- **orientation**  
By default the timepicker dropdown will be aligned to the bottom right of the input element, or aligned to the top left if there isn't enough room below the input. Force alignment with `l` (left), `r` (right), `t` (top), and `b` (bottom). Examples: `tl`, `rb`.
*default: 'l'*

- **roundingFunction**  
Function used to compute rounded times. The function will receive time in seconds and a settings object as arguments. The function should handle a null value for seconds.
*default: round to nearest step*

- **scrollDefault**  
If no time value is selected, set the dropdown scroll position to show the time provided, e.g. "09:00". A time string, Date object, or integer (seconds past midnight) is acceptible, as well as the string `'now'`.   
*default: null*

- **selectOnBlur**  
Update the input with the currently highlighted time value when the timepicker loses focus.  
*default: false*

- **show2400**  
Show "24:00" as an option when using 24-hour time format. You must also set `timeFormat` for this option to work.  
*default: false*

- **showDuration**  
Shows the relative time for each item in the dropdown. ```minTime``` or ```durationTime``` must be set.  
*default: false*

- **showOn**  
Display a timepicker dropdown when the input fires a particular event. Set to null or an empty array to disable automatic display. Setting should be an array of strings.
*default: ['focus']*

- **showOnFocus**  
DEPRECATED: Display a timepicker dropdown when the input gains focus.  
*default: true*

- **step**  
The amount of time, in minutes, between each item in the dropdown. Alternately, you can specify a function to generate steps dynamically. The function will receive a count integer (0, 1, 2...) and is expected to return a step integer.  
*default: 30*

- **stopScrollPropagation**  
When scrolling on the edge of the picker, it prevent parent containers (<body>) to scroll.
*default: false*

- **timeFormat**  
How times should be displayed in the list and input element. Uses [PHP's date() formatting syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php). Characters can be escaped with a preceeding double slash (e.g. `H\\hi`). Alternatively, you can specify a function instead of a string, to use completely custom time formatting. In this case, the format function receives a Date object and is expected to return a formatted time as a string.
*default: 'g:ia'*

- **typeaheadHighlight**  
Highlight the nearest corresponding time option as a value is typed into the form input.  
*default: true*

- **useSelect**  
Convert the input to an HTML `<SELECT>` control. This is ideal for small screen devices, or if you want to prevent the user from entering arbitrary values. This option is not compatible with the following options: ```appendTo```, ```closeOnWindowScroll```, ```disableTouchKeyboard```, ```forceRoundTime```, ```scrollDefault```, ```selectOnBlur```, ```typeAheadHighlight```.  
*default: false*

- **wrapHours**  
If a time greater than 24 hours (27:30, for example) is entered, apply modolo 24 to create a valid time. Setting this to `false` will cause an input of 27:30 to result in a `timeFormatError` event.  
*default: true*

Methods
-------

- **getSecondsFromMidnight**  
Get the time as an integer, expressed as seconds from 12am.

	```javascript
	$('#getTimeExample').timepicker('getSecondsFromMidnight');
	```

- **getTime**  
Get the time using a Javascript Date object, relative to a Date object (default: today's date).

	```javascript
	$('#getTimeExample').timepicker('getTime');
	$('#getTimeExample').timepicker('getTime', new Date());
	```

	You can get the time as a string using jQuery's built-in ```val()``` function:

	```javascript
	$('#getTimeExample').val();
	```

- **hide**  
Close the timepicker dropdown.

	```javascript
	$('#hideExample').timepicker('hide');
	```

- **isVisible**  
Check if the timepicker attached to *a specific input* is visible. Not compatible with the `useSelect` option.

	```javascript
	$('#hideExample').timepicker('isVisible');
	```

- **option**  
Change the settings of an existing timepicker. Calling ```option``` on a visible timepicker will cause the picker to be hidden.

	```javascript
	$('#optionExample').timepicker({ 'timeFormat': 'g:ia' }); // initialize the timepicker sometime earlier in your code
	...
	$('#optionExample').timepicker('option', 'minTime', '2:00am');
	$('#optionExample').timepicker('option', { 'minTime': '4:00am', 'timeFormat': 'H:i' });
	```

- **remove**  
Unbind an existing timepicker element.

	```javascript
	$('#removeExample').timepicker('remove');
	```

- **setTime**  
Set the time using a Javascript Date object.

	```javascript
	$('#setTimeExample').timepicker('setTime', new Date());
	```

- **show**  
Display the timepicker dropdown.

	```javascript
	$('#showExample').timepicker('show');
	```

Events
------

- **change**  
The native ```onChange``` event will fire any time the input value is updated, whether by selection from the timepicker list or manual entry into the text input. Your code should bind to ```change``` after initializing timepicker, or use [event delegation](http://api.jquery.com/on/).

- **changeTime**  
Called after a valid time value is entered or selected. See ```timeFormatError``` and ```timeRangeError``` for error events. Fires before ```change``` event.

- **hideTimepicker**  
Called after the timepicker is closed.

- **selectTime**  
Called after a time value is selected from the timepicker list. Fires before ```change``` event.

- **showTimepicker**  
Called after the timepicker is shown.

- **timeFormatError**  
Called if an unparseable time string is manually entered into the timepicker input. Fires before ```change``` event.

- **timeRangeError**  
Called if maxTime and minTime, or disableTimeRanges is set and an invalid time is manually entered into the timepicker input. Fires before ```change``` event.

The `selectTime` and `hideTimepicker` events fire slightly differently when using the `useSelect` option. See https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker/issues/427 for more information.

Theming
-------

Sample markup with class names:

```html
<input value="5:00pm" class="ui-timepicker-input" type="text">
...
<div class="ui-timepicker-wrapper ui-timepicker-positioned-top optional-custom-classname" tabindex="-1">
	<ul class="ui-timepicker-list">
		<li class="ui-timepicker-am">12:00am</li>
		<li class="ui-timepicker-am">12:30am</li>
		...
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm">4:30pm</li>
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm ui-timepicker-selected">5:00pm</li>
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm ui-timepicker-disabled">5:30pm</li>
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm">6:00pm <span class="ui-timepicker-duration">(1 hour)</span></li>
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm">6:30pm</li>
		...
		<li class="ui-timepicker-pm">11:30pm</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

The `ui-timepicker-positioned-top` class will be applied only when the dropdown is positioned above the input.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
