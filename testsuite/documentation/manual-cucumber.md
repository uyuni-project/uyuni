# Manual Cucumber - List of Manual Tests

### Introduction

  * This is Suse Manager QA "Manual Cucumber" - a list of scenarios and instructions to be tested manually.
  * **These tests are to be done at least once in a product cycle, and some are to be done multiple times at release milestones.**
  * Some of these tests intentionally duplicate automated tests.
  * This is a *living document* and as such subject to change in line with the agile nature of the project.

### Background information
  * For a high level view of testing, please refer to the [Test Plan](https://gitlab.suse.de/galaxy/testplan).
  * For the automated test suite, please refer to the ["real" Cucumber](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/tree/Manager/testsuite/features).

### Structure of this document
  * Manual Cucumber tests are split by the main component or functionality: server, clients, proxy, retail and other tests.
  * For each test scenario we specify its **priority**:
    * **all tests marked as 'high' must pass for the product to be released.**
  * The tests have information whether they should/could be automated.
  * The "smoke tests" must pass for the milestone to be validated
    * for more information and a list, please refer to test plan

### The priorities, with current count of tests per category, are:
  * high = mandatory (30 scenarios)
  * medium = important (39 scenarios)
  * low = not urgent (20 scenarios)

# 1. Server Tests <a name="a"/>

### 1.1 Server (fresh installation, x86_64)
* Priority: high
* Could be automated: yes (has been done in openQA but we don't get the qcow2 from it automatically yet)
1. Install on a x86_64 host **without terraform**, like our customers:
    1. Prepare a fresh disk of at least 180 GB on a VM or a real host
    1. Install SLE15 SP4 Virtual Machine from an [ISO image](http://dist.suse.de/install/SLE-15-SP3-Full-TEST/) or from some other installation source ([SSC-Proxy only for testing purpose](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/wiki/SCC-QA-proxy#installation-from-scratch-using-scc-proxy-40))
    1. At registration screen, register with your employee key (for betas use https://scc.suse.com/dashboard)
    1. When asked, answer you would like to install more repositories
    1. In extra software screen, un-filter the beta versions, and check SUSE Manager server latest version Beta
    1. Accept licence and enter beta key for SUSE Manager server latest version
    1. Accept default software selection (with X Window and GNOME)
    1. At partitioning screen, choose the default proposal
    1. Continue with installation screens
    1. After the system rebooted, make sure ``hostname -f`` gives the correct result
    1. Also make sure that SUSE Manager server software is installed with ``zypper search -t pattern``
    1. Set up the server with ``yast2 susemanager_setup``
    1. On credentials screen, enter "UC7" and the corresponding credential, and press "Test"
    1. Continue with [general server smoke tests here](#generalserversmoke).

### 1.2 Server (fresh installation, s390x)
* Priority: high
* Could be automated: yes (has been done in openQA but we don't get the qcow2 from it automatically yet)
1. Install on a s390x host with ``yast2 susemanager_setup``

1. Install on a ppc64le host with ``yast2 susemanager_setup``
1. Continue with [general server smoke tests here](#generalserversmoke).

### 1.4 Server Migration (from the older version to the latest version)
* Priority: high
* Could be automated: yes (basically what we do in MUs and later on 4.0->4.1)
1. Make sure both SLES and SUMA are registered with SCC.
1. Make sure spacewalk services are not running ``spacewalk-service stop``
1. Apply all patches for the old SUMA version by running ``zypper ref`` followed by ``zypper up``
1. Upgrade the database schema by running ``spacewalk-schema-upgrade``
1. Run to command that will perform migration ``zypper migration``
1. Select one of the options and let the migration process complete.
1. If necessary, upgrade the database schema again by running ``spacewalk-schema-upgrade``
1. Run the database migration script ``/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-X-to-Y``, where
   X is the old version of the database and Y the new one. For example: 10 for
   SUSE Manager 4.0, 12 for SUSE Manager 4.1, 13 for SUSE Manager 4.2.
1. Start the spacewalk services ``spacewalk-service start``
1. Continue using the migrated SUMA.

#### Sequence of test steps
General server smoke tests are: <a name="generalserversmoke"/>
1. Create initial organization, from Web UI
1. Make sure the credentials are accepted, from Web UI
1. Synchronize x86_64 repositories, from Web UI or ``spacewalk-repo-sync``
1. Add custom client-side channels as needed (tools, salt, python...)
1. Depending on which client you want to test, see the corresponding entry in the server documentation [for example the one for sle clients](https://suma-head-srv.mgr.suse.de/docs/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/clients-sle.html)
1. Synchronize the custom channels for BETA with ``spacewalk-repo-sync -c <name> -u <url>``
1. Perform package search
1. Create corresponding activation key
1. Add all children channels to activation key
1. Create bootstrap repository for clients (traditional or minions), with ``mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels``
1. Do one of the client tests below


Add custom client-side channels:
- Go to Software > Channel list > Create a channel
- Inside the Channel create a Repository pointing to one of the custom repos above
- After that you go to Manage Channel, then follow Repositories tab, and inside tap on Sync.

#### 4.1.1 Registering retail terminal with UEFI boot enabled

1. Modify saltboot formula in web UI, so `gpt` is used as a partition table type.
1. Install package `qemu-ovmf-x86_64` before creation of libvirt based VM.
1. When package installation is finished, multiple UEFI firmwares are available as `/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-*`.
1. Select UEFI instead of BIOS in _Hypervisor details_ menu via `virt-manager`.
1. Firmware `/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-ms-code.bin` is pre-selected by `virt-manager`. This cannot be changed via GUI, but only via `virsh edit` command.
1. VM's domain XML with configuration is very similar like in usual case using BIOS, important elements to check are:
```
  <sysinfo type='smbios'>
    <system>
      <entry name='manufacturer'>Intel</entry>
      <entry name='product'>Genuine</entry>
    </system>
  </sysinfo>

  <os>
    <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-2.9'>hvm</type>
    <!-- Key lines are below, edit carefully -->
    <loader readonly='yes' secure='no' type='pflash'>/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-opensuse-code.bin</loader>
    <nvram>/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/nvram/suma-40-efitest_VARS.fd</nvram>
    <smbios mode='sysinfo'/>
  </os>

  <interface type='network'>
    <mac address='****'/>
    <source network='suma-40-private'/>
    <model type='virtio'/>
    <boot order='1'/>
    <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>
  </interface>
```
**Important note:** Option `secure='no'` doesn't turn off secure boot feature. It is necessary to do it via UEFI menu during VM's boot. To enter UEFI configuration menu, just type `exit` in previous UEFI shell command prompt. Then you can disable secure boot.

#### 4.1.2 Registering retail terminal with EFI HTTP booting
1. This feature is for SLE15SP1 (JeOS7) terminals only, please build kiwi image for it first.
1. Follow the same steps from 4.1.1 section, so everything in the VM for retail terminal is ready for EFI booting
1. Configure DHCP formula as usual and fill `Filename Http:` input field with `http://[branch-server-FQDN-for-private network]/saltboot/boot/shim.efi`
1. Ensure default initrd is set to SLE15SP1 image (JeOS7). Check this path on branch server: `/srv/saltboot/boot` - both symlinks (initrd.gz and link) should point to files containg JeOS7
1. Change default boot option via UEFI menu during VM's boot and set it to *UEFI HTTPv4*. To enter UEFI configuration menu, press ESC and then type `exit` in UEFI shell command prompt
1. Restart and boot the terminal. The rest should follow as usual.
1. If you jump into error message `No mapping found` during booting, try to disable secure boot (see instructions above in section 4.1.1)

**Note:** Apache access log at the branch server should contain lines related to HTTP booting starting with `"HEAD /saltboot/boot/grub.efi HTTP/1.1" 200 - "-" "UefiHttpBoot/1.0"`

#### 4.1.3 Configuration with Multiple Branch Servers
1. Follow the same steps from 4.1 section
1. Create multiple groups named as branch prefixes according to the number of Branch servers
1. Prepare also multiple private virtual networks, one private network per Branch server
1. If you plan to use JeOS image as a base for 3.2 Branch server, assure the content of `/etc/zypp/zypp.conf` contains line `rpm.install.excludedocs = no`
1. This has to be done **before you install proxy pattern** on the branch server
1. Aftern proxy pattern is installed run `configure-proxy.sh` script as usual
1. Then check if content of the file `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` is not empty and contains line with `proxy.rhn_parent` set to the FQDN of the SUMA Server
1. When tests for the first branch server are finished (and terminals are successfully deployed), the easiest way to switch to the next Branch server is just to change private network
1. It is also suitable to recrate virtual HDD of terminal or restore it from the snapshot before terminals are rebooted

#### 4.1.4. USB stick for booting of retail terminal (instead of HTTP or PXE booting)
1. This feature is for SLE15SP1 (JeOS7) terminals only, please build kiwi image for it first
1. Follow the same steps from 4.1.1 section, this feature is available for both: EFI and legacy BIOS based terminals
1. Modify VM of branch server and add additional storage of size 512 MiB. Make sure it uses **USB bus**
1. Ensure default image is set to SLE15SP1 (JeOS7). You can do it by executing `salt-call pillar.item image-synchronize` at branch server, output should contain `POS_Image_Graphical7-7.0.0` or similar name
1. If default image is not set to JeOS7, do it in branch server profile at `Image Synchronization` formula. Then apply highstate
1. Prepare usb stick by executing `salt-call image_sync_usb.create /dev/sdX` at branch server assuming `/dev/sdX` points to the USB stisk you created in step 3
1. When this is successfully completed, please remove this storage from branch server's VM and add it to the VM for retail terminal
1. Ensure that **secure boot is disabled** in case of EFI usage, you can do it in EFI menu (just type exit and press ENTER at EFI prompt)
1. Set booting sequence so retail terminal boots from this USB stick device
1. Everything should follow like during usual retail terminal bootstrap (accept salt key etc.)

**NOTE:** If you encounter failure at "History > Events" page at profile of retail terminal stating `'Sum of partition sizes ({0}MiB) exceeds disk size ({1}MiB)'.format(size_known, disk_size - 1)) salt.exceptions.SaltException: Sum of partition sizes (1525MiB) exceeds disk size (511.0MiB)'` or similar, make sure saltboot formula points to the proper disk device. You use two devices now, so device you want for image deployment could be detected as `/dev/sdb`

#### 4.1.5 Force redeploy or repartition retail terminal
1. Deploy any retail terminal as usual
1. Run `salt "name-of-retail-terminal" state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy` from SUMA
1. Run `salt "name-of-retail-terminal" state.apply saltboot.force_repartition` as well
1. You should see these salt commands passed. (Terminal must be up and running.)
1. Change any partition size at saltboot formula for related system group to some different value
1. Reboot retail terminal via web UI
1. You should see kiwi image is being redeployed during next boot
1. You can check events page of this retail terminal. You should see new `Apply states [util.syncstates, saltboot]` event there
1. This event should contain states `saltboot_force_redeploy` and `saltboot_force_repartition`
1. You can also run `salt "name-of-retail-terminal" cmd-run lsbk` to see if new partitioning is used

#### 4.1.6 Boot and deployment of retail terminal via wifi connection
1. Real hardware is necessary for this test (retail terminal, wifi router or access point)
2. Setup SUSE Manager 4.1 and branch server localy at your workstation as a VMs using libvirt
3. Create second virtual network interface during branch server VM setup.
4. This interface has to be bridged to network interface at your workstation, which is expected to be connected to your router or access point (for example `Host device eth1: macvtap`)
5. Configure your wifi router / access point to be at regime with DHCP disabled as this is going to be provided via branch server
6. Configure wifi at this device to use WPA2 PSK, set credentials and save them for later use
7. Connect this device with your laptop as described at step 4.
8. Modify kiwi image profile `confix.xml` file for JeOS7 to include `dracut-wireless` package as follows:
```
	<package name="dracut-wireless"/>
```
9. We also have to provide credentials for wifi by creating `root/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0` file in kiwi image profile:
```
# ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD
WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name>
WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password>
```
10. Build kiwi image with these changes and create USB stick as described in [4.1.4](https://gitlab.suse.de/galaxy/testplan/-/blob/master/manual-cucumber.md) section above
11. Boot terminal from USB stick you previously created and terminal boot should proceed as usual

### 4.2 SUMA for Retail - Image Upgrade
* Priority: high
* Could be automated: to be confirmed
1. Set up SUMA for Retail
1. Register terminal using the image for older version of SLE 12 (like SLE 12 SP3)
1. Apply highstate on build host to clear kiwi created cache. (If not, older cached packages may be used when kiwi image is build.)
1. Build a new image for deployment, using newer version of SLE 12 SP4
1. Assign the new image to the terminal by changing field `OS Image to Deploy` to the name of SLE 12 SP4 image at saltboot formula page on HWTYPE system group of this terminal
1. Restart the terminal
1. Confrm that the new SLE is running on the terminal

### 4.3 SUMA for Retail - Migration from SLEPOS
* Priority: high
* Could be automated: yes (all steps already done excepted the first 2 ones)
1. Get an existing XML files from Retail team. Those are currently [provided](https://gitlab.suse.de/SLEPOS/SUMA_Retail/tree/master/doc/migration/test_data). (Prepare two SLE15SP1 based VMs as a branch servers to be used for import.)
1. Check for duplicates in source XML file and also check for too long names (longer than 56 characters) of HWTYPE groups and correct if necessary. (Both is documented in official docs.)
1. Convert XML to yaml file with ``retail_migration`` command
1. Edit yaml file to match kiwi images to be used if it is not possible to use the exported ones
1. Prepare one (or more) branch servers accordingly to generated yaml file
1. Apply that configuration file with ``retail_yaml`` command
1. Check that the branch server is configured accordingly to yaml file
1. Check that the the empty terminal profiles are created accordingly to yaml file
1. Prepare VM for terminal and modify it (via `virsh edit` command) to match MAC address and HWTYPE group of one of imported terminals (please see YAML file or DHCP formula on branch server)
1. Register for real one of these terminals
1. Proceed with POS terminal health-check after registration
