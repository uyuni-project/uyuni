Beginning with SLE 12 {suse} supports service pack skipping, it is now possible to migrate from for example, SLE 12 SP2 to SLE 12 SP4.
Note that SLE 11 may only be migrated step by step and individual service packs should not be skipped.
Supported migrations include any of the following:

* SLE 11 > SLE 11 SP1 > SLE 11 SP2 > SLE 11 SP3 > SLE 11 SP4
* SLE 12 > SLE 12 SP1 > SLE 12 SP2 > SLE 12 SP3 > SLE 12 SP4
* SLE 12 SP2 > SLE 12 SP4 (skipping SLE 12 SP3)



[WARNING]
.Migrating from an Earlier Version of SLES
