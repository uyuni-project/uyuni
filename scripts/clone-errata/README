The purpose of this script is to pull errata from RHN and
import them into Spacewalk channels.  There is some basic
proxy support included in the script.

The script self-documents as much as possible.  Typical usage
would be something like this:

rhn-clone-errata.py -f /root/.rhnscript \
                    -c rhel-x86_64-server-6 \
                    -b `date +"\%Y\%m\%d" -d "-1 week"` \
                    -i

usage: rhn-clone-errata.py [options]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SPW_SERVER, --spw-server=SPW_SERVER
                        Spacewalk Server (spacewalk.mydomain.org)
  -S RHN_SERVER, --rhn-server=RHN_SERVER
                        RHN Server (rhn.redhat.com)
  -u SPW_USER, --spw-user=SPW_USER
                        Spacewalk User
  -p SPW_PASS, --spw-pass=SPW_PASS
                        Spacewalk Password
  -U RHN_USER, --rhn-user=RHN_USER
                        RHN User
  -P RHN_PASS, --rhn-pass=RHN_PASS
                        RHN Password
  -f CFG_FILE, --config-file=CFG_FILE

  -b BDATE, --begin-date=BDATE
                        Beginning Date: ie. "19000101" (defaults to
                        "19000101")
  -e EDATE, --end-date=EDATE

  -i, --publish         Publish Errata (into destination channels)
  -I, --ignoremissing   Default behavior is to skip errata for which
                        there are missing packages, this option
                        allows the errata to be created without
                        packages that it should have.
  -A, --sync-all-channels
                        This option clones errata for all channels
                        configured in the config file.
  -x PROXY, --proxy=PROXY
                        Proxy server and port to use (e.g.

  --no-spw-proxy        Don't proxy the Spacewalk server connection. (Proxy by
                        default, if proxy is set)
  --no-rhn-proxy        Don't proxy the RHN server connection. (Proxy by

        I'm presently working on adding in support for CVEs
        but am running into an issue.  Probably done in
        version 1.6 ...

2011/11/17 - Andy speagle

        Default behavior of how errata with missing packages
        are handled has been changed.  If an errata is missing
        packages, the script will now, by default, skip creating
        that errata.  You can use "-I" to ignore missing packages
        and continue creating the errata.
