= Contact Methods

There are a number of ways that the {productname} Server can communicate with clients.
Which one you use depends on your network architecture.

The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.
It does not apply to Salt clients.

Push via SSH and Push via Salt SSH are used in environments where clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

OSAD is an alternative contact method between {productname} and its clients.
OSAD allows registered client systems to execute scheduled actions immediately.
