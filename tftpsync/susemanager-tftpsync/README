Sync cobbler generated tftp boot directory to SUSE Manager Proxies
==================================================================

How to configure the SUSE Manager Proxy?
----------------------------------------

1) install susemanager-tftpsync-recv package on your SUSE Manager Proxy

2) execute configure-tftpsync.sh on SUSE Manager Proxy

   This setup script asks for hostnames and IP addreses of the
   SUSE Manager Server and of the proxy itself.
   Additionally it asks for the tftpboot directory on the proxy.

   See also configure-tftpsync.sh --help


How to configure the SUSE Manager Server?
-----------------------------------------

1) install susemanager-tftpsync package on your SUSE Manager Server

2) execute configure-tftpsync.sh on SUSE Manager Server

   usage: configure-tftpsync.sh proxy1.domain.top proxy2.domain.top

3) finally execute "cobber sync" to initially push the files to the
   proxies

Note: You can call configure-tftpsync.sh to change the list of proxies.
      You always have to provide the full list of proxies.

Note: In case you reinstall an already configured proxy and want to push all files
      again you need to remove the cache file '/var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json'
      before you call 'cobbler sync' again.

Requirements:
-------------

The SUSE Manager Server needs to be able to access the
SUSE Manager Proxies directly. Push via proxies is not possible.
