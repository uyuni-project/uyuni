class SequenceServer:

    """Given a sequence to serve, this class dishes them out in chunks
    or one at a time. This was written originally to reduce redundant
    code. Used only by class Syncer.

    This class was written so that a chunk can be snagged and
    processed. If the processing fails, one can tell the class to only
    present one at a time until that chunk is complete... and then
    resume normal operations.

    For example: the sequence can be a bunch of packageIds. We try to
    process all data that corresponds to some chunk of those package
    ids. If that process fails, we go back and reprocess that chunk,
    one at a time, until it is complete (identifying precisely which
    package broke). Then we resume processing a chunk at a time.
