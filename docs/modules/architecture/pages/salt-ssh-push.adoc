= Salt SSH Push






Salt SSH Push is intended to be used in environments where your Salt clients cannot reach the {productname} server directly to regularly checking in and, for example, fetch package updates.

.Push via SSH
[NOTE]
====
This feature is not related to Push via SSH for the traditional clients.
For Push via SSH, see pass:c[xref:bp.contact.methods.ssh.push[Salt SSH Push]].

== Overview

.Push via Salt SSH Contact Method

image::salt-ssh-contact-taigon.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Salt provides "`Salt SSH`"
 ([command]``salt-ssh``), a feature to manage clients from a server.
It works without installing Salt related software on clients.
Using Salt SSH there is no need to have clients connected to the Salt master.
Using this as a {productname} connect method, this feature provides similar functionality for Salt clients as the traditional Push via SSH feature for traditional clients.

This feature allows:

* Managing Salt entitled systems with the Push via SSH contact method using Salt SSH.
* Bootstrapping such systems.



== Requirements

* SSH daemon must be running on the remote system and reachable by the [systemitem]``salt-api`` daemon (typically running on the {productname} server).
* Python must be available on the remote system (Python must be supported by the installed Salt). Currently: python 2.6.

.Unsupported Systems
[NOTE]
====
{rhel}
and CentOS versions <= 5 are not supported because they do not have Python 2.6 by default.
====



== Bootstrapping

To bootstrap a Salt SSH system, proceed as follows:

. Open the menu:Bootstrap Minions[] dialog in the Web UI (menu:Systems[Bootstrapping] ).
. Fill out the required fields. Select an menu:Activation Key[] with the menu:Push via SSH[] contact method configured. For more information about activation keys, see:
 pass:c[xref:ref.webui.systems.activ-keys].
. Check the menu:Manage system completely via SSH[] option.
. Confirm with clicking the menu:Bootstrap[] button.


Now the system will be bootstrapped and registered in {productname}.
If done successfully, it will appear in the menu:Systems[] list.



== Configuration

There are two kinds of parameters for Push via Salt SSH:

* Bootstrap-time parameters {mdash} configured in the menu:Bootstrapping[] page:
** Host
** Activation key
** Password {mdash} used only for bootstrapping, not saved anywhere; all future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair
* Persistent parameters {mdash} configured {productname}-wide:
** sudo user {mdash} same as in pass:c[bp.contact.methods.ssh.push.sudo].



== Action Execution

The Push via Salt SSH feature uses a taskomatic job to execute scheduled actions using [command]``salt-ssh``.
The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them.
While on traditional clients with SSH push configured only [command]``mgr_check`` is executed via SSH, the Salt SSH push job executes a complete [command]``salt-ssh`` call based on the scheduled action.



== Known Limitation

* OpenSCAP auditing is not available on Salt SSH clients.
* Beacons do not work with Salt SSH.
** Installing a package on a system using [command]``zypper`` will not invoke the package refresh.
** Virtual Host functions (for example, a host to guests) will not work if the virtual host system is Salt SSH-based.
