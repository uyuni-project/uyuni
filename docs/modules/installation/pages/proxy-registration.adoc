[[proxy-register]]
= SUSE Manager Proxy Registration

{productname} Proxy systems are registered as traditional clients or as Salt clients using a bootstrap script.
Migrating a traditionally registered Proxy system to a Salt Proxy system is not possible.
Re-install the Proxy if you want to switch to Salt.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed {productname} Proxy with an activation key as a {productname} client.

[IMPORTANT]
.Downloading Channels
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have completely downloaded the {productname} Proxy 4 channel and all the recommended and mandatory {sle} 15 SP1 channels.

.Procedure: Registering the Proxy

. Create an activation key based on the [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.0-Pool`` base channel.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[Creating Activation Key].

* SLE-Module-Basesystem15-SP1-Updates
* SLE-Module-Server-Applications15-SP1-Pool
* SLE-Module-Server-Applications15-SP1-Updates
* SLE-Module-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.0-Pool

. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy if needed.
If you want to run the proxy on a traditional client (system type ``Management``) uncheck [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt``.
Using Salt is the default.
// What's up with:
// Enable Remote Configuration
// Enable Remote Commands
For more information about bootstrap scripts, see
xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

.Modifying Bootstrap Script

. Create the SUSE Manager Tools Repository for bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:creating-a-tools-repository.adoc[Create Tools Repository].
. Bootstrap the client with the bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
. For Salt clients, accept the key on the menu:Salt[Keys] page by checking the appropriate checkbox.
When accepted, it will appear in the menu:Systems[Overview].
. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and check that the four proxy channels ([systemitem]``Pool`` and [systemitem]``Updates`` for [systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT`` and [systemitem]``SLE-MODULE``) plus the recommended channels are selected.
[systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT-Pool`` must be the base channel and the others are child channels.
