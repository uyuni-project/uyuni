= Required Network Ports

This section contains a comprehensive list of ports that are used for various communications within {productname}.

You will not need to open all of these ports.
Some ports only need to be opened if you are using the service that requires them.

This image shows the main ports used in {productname}:

== External Inbound Server Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to protect the server from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} Server.

.External Port Requirements for {productname} Server
|===
| Port number | Protocol | Used By | Notes
| 67          | TCP/UDP  | DHCP    | Required only if clients are requesting IP addresses from the server.
| 69          | TCP/UDP  | TFTP    | Required if server is used as a PXE server for automated client installation.
| 80          | TCP      | HTTP    | Required temporarily for some bootstrap repositories and automated installations.
Port 80 is not used to serve the {webui}.
| 443         | TCP      | HTTPS   | {webui}, client, and proxy requests.
| 4505        |  TCP     | salt    | Required to accept communication requests from clients.
The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to receive commands from the Salt master.
| 4506        | TCP      | salt    | Required to accept communication requests from clients.
The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to report results back to the Salt master.
| 5222        | TCP      | osad    | Required to push OSAD actions to clients.
| 5269        | TCP      | jabberd | Required to push actions to and from a proxy.
| 25151       | TCP      | Cobbler |

== External Outbound Server Ports

External outbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to restrict what the server can access.

Opening these ports allows network traffic from the {productname} Server to communicate with external services.

== Internal Server Ports

Internal port are used internally by the {productname} Server.
Internal ports are only accessible from ``localhost``.

In most cases, you will not need to adjust these ports.

| Port number | Notes
| 2828        | Satellite-search API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 2829        | Taskomatic API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.
| 6868        | Auditlog-keeper to database.

| 8080        | Tomcat to Apache HTTPD (HTTP).
| 9080        | Salt-API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 32000       | Port for a TCP connection to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs Taskomatic and satellite-search.

Port 32768 and higher are used as ephemeral ports.
These are most often used to receive TCP connections.
When a TCP connection request is received, the sender will choose one of these ephemeral port numbers to match the destination port.
You can use this command to find out which ports are ephemeral ports:

----
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
----



== External Inbound Proxy Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Proxy to protect the proxy from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} proxy.
