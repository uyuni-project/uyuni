[Uyuni](https://www.uyuni-project.org/) is an open source systems management solution, forked
from [Spacewalk](https://spacewalkproject.github.io/).

It is the upstream community project from which [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/)
is derived.

We are just doing a test here about PR review approvals.
