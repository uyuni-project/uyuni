    <question>
      <para>When trying to call a specific function, the error <quote>Fault returned from XML RPC Server,
fault code -1: Could not find method METHOD in class...</quote>  is given. What is wrong?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>Typically this is seen when either a function name is being called that doesn't exist, the number
of parameters for a particular function is incorrect, or the type of a passed parameter is incorrect (Such as
an array is expected, but a String is passed). Check all of these things.</para>
