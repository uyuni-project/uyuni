# Test Architecture

## General

We have three kind of test suites in this project, each of them has its own purpose and workflow:

- **CI Test Suite**: This test suite is executed periodically on the Jenkins pipelines, we run it for each of our released versions, plus our main branch. It's composed by a set of tests that covers all the server features and three kind of operating systems as clients. The main goal is to ensure that the server is working as expected and these clients can be managed by the server.
- **Build Validation Test Suite**: This test suite is executed on the Jenkins pipelines, but for now it's triggered only manually. Its purpose is to validate new maintenance updates or new versions of our product. It's composed by a set of tests that cover a very minimal setup of the server and the proxy/RBS, plus all the supported clients including basic operations on them.
- **GitHub Validation Test Suite**: This test suite is executed with GitHub Actions, it's triggered for each pull request, and it's composed by a sub-set of the tests from the CI Test Suite, those that can be executed on a GitHub runner. The main goal is to give fast feedback to the developers about the changes they are introducing with a pull request.

## Test Suites

### CI Test Suite

The CI Test Suite is composed by the following stages:

- **Core**: This stage setups the server, so it can be used by the following tests.
- **RepoSync**: The goal of this stage is to synchronize the products that correspond to the clients that will be used in the tests, but it also takes care of creating the custom channels and activation keys that we need to bootstrap and manage the clients.
- **Init Clients**: This stage bootstraps and onboards a proxy, a build host, a virtualization host, plus a sub-set of the supported clients.
- **Secondary**: This stage has all the different server features that we want to cover. We have this stage split in two, because there are some tests that in theory can run in parallel, but in practice we still have issues that way, so we have to run them sequentially.
- **Finishing**: This stage collects some logs and metrics from the system, so we can debug and analyze the results of the tests. It also includes a test that must run at the end, to validate the database backup and restore feature.

### Test Infrastructure

In this test environment, we configure all the components required to run the server features. The components are:

- **Server**: The main component of the system. It is containerized and serves as the central server responsible for managing clients, repositories, channels, activation keys, images, and more.
- **Proxy**: A containerized component that redirects actions from the server to the clients.
- **Retail Branch Server**: This component manages the retail environment, a specialized setup that handles terminals, also known as points of sale.
- **Monitoring Server**: This component monitors the server and clients. It consists of two key subcomponents:
    - **Prometheus Server**: Responsible for storing metrics.
    - **Grafana Server**: Displays metrics in a graphical format.
- **Prometheus Exporter**: Installed on the server and clients, this component exports their metrics to the Monitoring Server.
- **Build Host**: This component builds the images deployed on the terminals in the retail environment.
- **DHCP/DNS Server**: Provides IP addresses and DNS resolution for the terminals in the retail environment.
- **Debian-like Minion**: Acts as a Debian-based client. Currently, an Ubuntu distribution is used.
- **RedHat-like Minion**: Acts as a RedHat-based client. Currently, a Rocky distribution is used.
- **SUSE Minion**: Acts as a SUSE client. A SLES distribution is used for MLM, while a Leap distribution is used for Uyuni.
- **SUSE SSH Minion**: Similar to the SUSE Minion but uses Salt-SSH instead of Salt.

#### How do we include the code changes that we want to test?

We rely on [Sumaform](https://github.com/uyuni-project/sumaform) to deploy our VM instances for each of our components. Sumaform not only deploys the VM, but also configures all what we need inside each system, it leverages Salt for that purpose.
As part of the Salt states configuring the systems, we have a state that injects repositories into the system, that points to the IBS/OBS repositories containing our packages in development for each release version, including main branch.

Those repositories are not directly handled by our server, so during the reposync stage we create custom channels with new custom repositories that will parse and include the repositories injected by Sumaform.
These custom channels will be part of the activation keys that we use to bootstrap the different clients.

#### How do we speed up the workflow to onboard the clients?

Normally a customer will trigger a full synchronization of a product, including all the mandatory and recommended channels. This process can take a long time, depending on the number of packages and the network speed.
In our CI Test Suite we want to speed up this workflow by synchronizing only the necessary packages to generate the bootstrap repository for the clients.

For now, this only applies to our Leap Minion in our Uyuni flavor, but the plan is to extend this to the MLM and other clients as well:
We first need to trigger a synchronization of the channel through `spacewalk-common-channel`, but then we immediately kill that repo-sync process, we need this as otherwise the following command will fail, warning about a non-existing custom channel.
After that, we run the command `spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channel> --include <package> --include <package> ...` for each of the packages that define as part of our bootstrap repository.
This way we can speed up the synchronization process, and we can bootstrap the clients immediately after that. The rest of the product channels will automatically be synchronized by the scheduled tasks when it reaches the time to do so.

#### Overview of Channels and Repositories

The current overview of channels and repositories is as follows:

- **Proxy**:
  - **On MLM**: SLE Micro product channels are fully synchronized by the server, along with sub-channels related to the Proxy extension.
  - **On Uyuni**:
    - **On Cloud**: openSUSE Leap product channels are partially synchronized by the server, along with Uyuni Proxy Devel and Uyuni Client Tools sub-channels.
    - **On KVM Host**: openSUSE Leap Micro product channels are partially synchronized by the server, along with Uyuni Proxy Devel and Uyuni Client Tools sub-channels.

- **Build Host**:
  - SLES product channels are fully synchronized by the server.

- **Terminals**:
  - SLES product channels are fully synchronized by the server.
  - **As child channels**:
    - A fake channel with a repository containing fake packages and patches.

- **SUSE Minions**:
  - **On MLM**: SLES product channels are fully synchronized by the server.
  - **On Uyuni**: Leap product channels are partially synchronized by the server, meaning only the minimal dependencies required to generate the bootstrap repository are included.
  - **As child channels**:
    - A fake channel with a repository containing fake packages and patches.
    - A development channel with development repositories injected by Sumaform.
  - Additional repositories injected by Sumaform may also be included, but they are not directly handled by the server.

- **Debian-like Minion**:
  - A fake channel with a repository containing fake packages and patches.
  - **As child channels**:
    - A development channel with development repositories injected by Sumaform.
  - Additional repositories injected by Sumaform may also be included, but they are not directly handled by the server, for instance the Ubuntu Universe repository.

- **RedHat-like Minion**:
  - A fake channel with a repository containing fake packages and patches.
  - **As child channels**:
    - A development channel with development repositories injected by Sumaform.
  - Additional repositories injected by Sumaform may also be included, but they are not directly handled by the server.

### Build Validation Test Suite

The Build Validation Test Suite is composed by the following stages:

- **Sanity Check**: This stage checks that all the nodes are up and we can interact with them.
- **Core**: This stage setups the server, so it can be used by the following tests.
- **RepoSync**: The goal of this stage is to synchronize the products that correspond to the clients that will be used in the tests.
- **Add MU Repositories**: This stage setups the custom repositories that are part of the maintenance updates.
- **Add Non-MU Repositories**: This stage setups the custom repositories that are not part of the maintenance updates, like the repositories containing certain ISO files.
- **Create bootstrap repositories**: This stage creates the bootstrap repositories that are used to bootstrap the clients.
- **Init Clients**: This stage bootstraps and onboards a proxy plus all the supported clients.
- **Init Monitoring**: This stage setups the monitoring server.
- **Retail**: This stage setups the retail environment, and run the retail tests.
- **Migration**: This stage tests the migration from different product versions, and between Salt implementations.
- **Finishing**: This stage collects some logs and metrics from the system, so we can debug and analyze the results of the tests. It also includes a test that must run at the end, to validate the database backup and restore feature.

#### How we include the maintenance updates that we want to test?

We rely on Sumaform to deploy our VM instances for each of our components. Sumaform not only deploys the VM, but also configures all what we need inside each system, it leverages Salt for that purpose.
In such setup, we don't rely on repositories injected by Sumaform, because we are not testing the development repositories, but the maintenance updates repositories.

We create custom channels and repositories that will contain the maintenance udates repositories, and we use them to bootstrap the clients.

### GitHub Validation Test Suite

The GitHub Validation Test Suite is composed by the following stages:

- **Core**: This stage setups the server, creates fake custom channels, and activation keys.
- **Init Clients**: This stage don't really bootstrap the clients, but just do a minimal check and subscribe to the needed fake channels.
- **Secondary**: This stage is split into five different GitHub Actions jobs, each one covering a different server feature. Note that we don't have the same coverage as the CI Test Suite, because we are limited by the GitHub runner support on some features.

#### How do we include the code changes that we want to test?

On the GitHub setup, we don't have a deployment with Sumaform, instead we run each component in a new container.
Regarding the server container, we have a script to build it from the source code, so it includes all new changes from a pull request.
