Feature: Bootstrap a Salt host managed via salt-ssh

@ssh_minion
  Scenario: Bootstrap a SLES system managed via salt-ssh
    Given I am authorized
    And I go to the bootstrapping page
    Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
    And I check "manageWithSSH"
    And I enter the hostname of "ssh_minion" as "hostname"
    And I enter "linux" as "password"
    And I select the hostname of "proxy" from "proxies"
    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "Successfully bootstrapped host!" text
    And I am on the System Overview page
    And I wait until I see the name of "ssh_minion", refreshing the page
    And I wait until onboarding is completed for "ssh_minion"

# HACK
# Package 'sle-manager-tools-release' is automatically installed during bootstrap and
# stays installed after removal of channel containing it. So it is not possible to update it.
# Package needs to be removed from highstate to avoid failure when updating it.
