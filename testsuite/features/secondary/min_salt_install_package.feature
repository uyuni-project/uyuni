    And I run "zypper -n ref" on "sle_minion"

  Scenario: Pre-requisite: refresh package list and check old packages installed on SLE minion
    When I refresh packages list via spacecmd on "sle_minion"
    And I wait until refresh package list on "sle_minion" is finished
    Then spacecmd should show packages "virgo-dummy-1.0" installed on "sle_minion"

  Scenario: Pre-requisite: ensure the errata cache is computed before patching Salt minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Software" in the content area
    And I follow "List / Remove" in the content area
    And I enter "virgo-dummy" as the filtered package name
    And I click on the filter button until page does contain "virgo-dummy" text
