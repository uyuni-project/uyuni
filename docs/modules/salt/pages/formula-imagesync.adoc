= Image Synchronization Formula

The Image Synchronization formula is used to configure when OS images are synchronized to the branch server, and to specify which images to synchronize.

If this formula is not enabled, synchronization must be started manually, and all images will be synchronized.


.Procedure: Configuring Image Synchronization

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab.
. Check the [guimenu]``Image Synchronize`` formula, and click btn:[Save].
. Navigate to the menu:Formulas[Image Synchronize] tab, and set these parameters:
* Check the [guimenu]``Include Image Synchronization in Highstate`` field to have image synchronization occur every time highstate is applied.
This ensures that you do not have to perform image synchronization manually, however it requires a high bandwidth environment.
* In the [guimenu]``Synchronize only the listed images`` field, click btn:[Add item] to add the images you want to have synchronized automatically.
Alternatively, you can leave this list blank to have all images synchronized.
. Click btn:[Save Formula] to save your configuration.
. Apply the highstate.
