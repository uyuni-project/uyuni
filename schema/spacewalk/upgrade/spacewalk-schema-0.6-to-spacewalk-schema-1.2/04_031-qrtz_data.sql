-- A hint submitted by a user: Oracle DB MUST be created as "shared" and the
-- job_queue_processes parameter  must be greater than 2, otherwise a DB lock
-- will happen.   However, these settings are pretty much standard after any
-- Oracle install, so most users need not worry about this.
--
-- Many other users (including the primary author of Quartz) have had success
-- runing in dedicated mode, so only consider the above as a hint ;-)
