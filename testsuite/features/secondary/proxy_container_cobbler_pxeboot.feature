Feature: PXE boot a terminal with Cobbler and containerized proxy
  In order to automate client system installations with a containerized proxy
  As the system administrator
  I want to PXE boot one host with Cobbler

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Start Cobbler monitoring
    When I start local monitoring of Cobbler

  # We currently test Cobbler with a SLES 15 SP4 terminal
  # The build host has same version as the terminal
  Scenario: Prepare the autoinstallation files on the server
    When I install packages "tftpboot-installation-SLE-15-SP4-x86_64 expect" on this "build_host"
    And I copy the tftpboot installation files from the build host to the server
    And I copy the distribution inside the container on the server

  Scenario: Create auto installation distribution

    And I follow "Create Distribution"
    And I enter "SLE-15-SP4-TFTP" as "label"
    And I enter "/srv/www/distributions/SLE-15-SP4-TFTP/" as "basepath"
