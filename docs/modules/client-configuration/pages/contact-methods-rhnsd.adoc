= SUSE Manager Daemon (rhnsd)


The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.
It does not apply to Salt clients.

It is only used on {sle}{nbsp}11 and {rhnminrelease6}, as these systems do not use systemd.
On later operating systems, a systemd timer ([systemitem]``rhnsd.timer``) is used and controlled by [systemitem]``rhnsd.service``.

Start the daemon with [command]``/etc/init.d/rhnsd``.

By default, it will check every four hours for new actions.
This means it can take some time for clients to execute scheduled actions.

To check for updates, [systemitem]``rhnsd`` runs the external [systemitem]``mgr_check`` program located in [path]``/usr/sbin/``.
This is a small application that establishes the network connection to {productname}.
The SUSE Manager daemon does not listen on any network ports or talk to the network directly.
All network activity is performed by the [systemitem]``mgr_check`` utility.

This figure provides an overview of the default [systemitem]``rhnsd`` process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Python XMLRPC server`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

== Configure rhnsd

The `rhnsd` initialization script has a configuration file on the client system at [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd``.

An important parameter for the daemon is its check-in frequency.
The default interval time is four hours (240 minutes).
The minimum allowed time interval is one hour (60 minutes).
If you set the interval below one hour, it will change back to the default of 4 hours (240 minutes).

If you modify the `rhnsd` configuration file, execute this command as root to restart the daemon and pick up your changes:
----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd restart
----

To see the status of `rhnsd`, use this command as root:
----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd status
----

On {sle}{nbsp}12 and later, the default time interval is set in [path]``/etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/rhnsd.timer``, in this section:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/4:00
RandomizedDelaySec=30min
----

You can create an overriding drop-in file for [path]``rhnsd.timer`` using [command]``systemctl``:

----
systemctl edit rhnsd.timer
----

For example, if you want configure a two hour time interval:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/2:00
----

The file will be saved as [path]``/etc/systemd/system/rhnsd.timer.d/override.conf``.

For more information about system timers, see the [command]``systemd.timer`` and [command]``systemctl`` manpages.
