Feature: CVE audit for content management
  I want to see images that need to be patched or not

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Schedule channel data refresh for content management
    When I follow the left menu "Admin > Task Schedules"
    And I follow "cve-server-channels-default"
    And I follow "cve-server-channels-bunch"
    And I click on "Single Run Schedule"
    Then I should see a "bunch was scheduled" text
    And I wait until the table contains "FINISHED" or "SKIPPED" followed by "FINISHED" in its first rows

  Scenario: Audit images, searching for a known CVE number
    When I follow the left menu "Audit > CVE Audit"
    And I select "1999" from "cveIdentifierYear"
    And I enter "9999" as "cveIdentifierId"
    And I click on "Audit Images"
    Then I should see a "No action required" text

  Scenario: Audit images, searching for an unknown CVE number
    When I follow the left menu "Audit > CVE Audit"
    And I select "2012" from "cveIdentifierYear"
    And I enter "2806" as "cveIdentifierId"
    And I click on "Audit Images"
    Then I should see a "The specified CVE number was not found" text
