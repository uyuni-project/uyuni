  As an authorized user
  I want to migrate this CentOS 7 traditional client to a Salt minion

    When I am on the Systems overview page of this "ceos_client"
    And I follow "Delete System"
    Then I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    When I click on "Delete Profile"
    And I wait until I see "has been deleted" text
    Then "ceos_client" should not be registered

    When I enable repository "CentOS-Base" on this "ceos_client"

    And I install OpenSCAP dependencies on "ceos_client"
