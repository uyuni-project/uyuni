Feature: Salt is configured and running
  In order to operate SUSE Manager based on Salt
  I want to use general Salt functionality and system registration

  Scenario: salt-api is properly configured
    When I get the contents of the remote file "/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf"
    Then it should contain a "rest_cherrypy:" text
    And it should contain a "port: 9080" text
    And it should contain a "external_auth:" text

  Scenario: salt-master and salt-api are listening
    Then salt-api should be listening on local port 9080
    And salt-master should be listening on public port 4505
    And salt-master should be listening on public port 4506

  Scenario: salt-minion is running on SLES minion
    Given salt-minion is configured on "sle-minion"
    When I restart salt-minion on "sle-minion"
    Then salt-minion should be running on "sle-minion"

  Scenario: The SLES minion appears in the master's incoming queue
    Then the list of the "all" keys should contain "sle-minion" hostname

  Scenario: There are no top.sls files in certain folders
    When I run "ls /srv/susemanager/salt/top.sls" on "server" without error control
    Then the command should fail
    When I run "ls /srv/susemanager/salt/top.sls" on "server" without error control
    Then the command should fail
    When I run "ls /srv/susemanager/pillar/top.sls" on "server" without error control
    Then the command should fail
    When I run "ls /usr/share/susemanager/salt/top.sls" on "server" without error control
    Then the command should fail
    When I run "ls /usr/share/susemanager/pillar/top.sls" on "server" without error control
    Then the command should fail
