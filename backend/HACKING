Before running the backend unit tests you'll need to do the following:

 * yum install python-nose python-pgsql
 * export SPACEWALK_GIT=~/src/spacewalk
   * Adjust accordingly to point to the top level of your spacewalk git clone.
   * Probably wise to add to your ~/.bashrc or equivalent.

To run the pure unit tests (no disk/network/db access):

    pytest -s test/unit/
