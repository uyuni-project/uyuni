# WORKAROUND: If ivy build fails, try again, because 50% of times fails when
# downloading the new jar files from download.opensuse.org.
# 
# build.opensuse.org publishes our packages into download.opensuse.org. However,
# this is not a "static" directory. If packages get rebuild, old packages are
# removed, new packages are published and new metadata is created. Then, the
# whole thing is updated in the download.opensuse.org mirrors all around the
# world.
#
# Packages from devel repos can get rebuild any time, i.e. when their
# dependencies are updates (i.e. java).
# 
# Thus, the repos from devel projects that are published into
# download.opensuse.org, are not stable, their metadata can get rebuilt at any
# time, packages are removed, etc. and plus, this takes time to be propagated,
# so mirrors are very often outdated, have outdated metadata or outdated
# packages, or both.
#
# So, we can not consider download.opensuse.org reliable for devel projects.
# While we do not have a mirror for the jar files, the easiest workaround is
# to try again and hope it succeeds.
