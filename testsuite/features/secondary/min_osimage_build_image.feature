    And I select the hostname of "sle_minion" from "buildHostId"
    And I click on "submit-btn"
    # Check the OS image built as Kiwi image administrator
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I should see a "[OS Image Build Host]" text
    And I wait at most 3300 seconds until event "Image Build suse_os_image scheduled by kiwikiwi" is completed
