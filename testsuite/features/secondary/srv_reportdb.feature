@scope_reportdb
Feature: ReportDB
  In order to use reporting tools
  As an authorized user
  I want to be able to access and use the Report Database named "reportdb"

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Populate the report database after bootstrapping minions
    When I schedule a task to update ReportDB

  Scenario: Connect to the ReportDB on the server with admin user
    Given I can connect to the ReportDB on the Server
    And I have a user with admin access to the ReportDB

  Scenario: Create read-only user
    When I create a read-only user for the ReportDB
    Then I should see the read-only user listed on the ReportDB user accounts

  Scenario: External read-only user can connect to ReportDB and make queries
    When I connect to the ReportDB with read-only user from external machine
    Then I should be able to query the ReportDB

  Scenario: Read-only user can't make changes in the ReportDB
    Then I should not be able to "insert" data in a ReportDB "table" as a read-only user
    And I should not be able to "update" data in a ReportDB "table" as a read-only user
    And I should not be able to "delete" data in a ReportDB "table" as a read-only user
    And I should not be able to "insert" data in a ReportDB "view" as a read-only user
    And I should not be able to "update" data in a ReportDB "view" as a read-only user
    And I should not be able to "delete" data in a ReportDB "view" as a read-only user

  Scenario: ReportDB admin user can't access product database from external machine
    Given I know the ReportDB admin user credentials
    Then I should be able to connect to the ReportDB with the ReportDB admin user
    And I should not be able to connect to product database with the ReportDB admin user

  Scenario: The systems should match between the UI and the ReportDB
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > System List > All"
    And I make a list of the existing systems
    Then I should find the systems from the UI in the ReportDB

@sle_minion
  Scenario: System changes should be reflected in systems, on ReportDB
    Given I have a property "City" with value "Arrakeen" on "sle_minion"
    And I know the current synced_date for "sle_minion"
    When I schedule a task to update ReportDB
    Then I should find the updated "City" property as "Arrakeen" on the "sle_minion", on ReportDB

  Scenario: Cleanup: delete read-only user
    When I delete the read-only user for the ReportDB
    Then I shouldn't see the read-only user listed on the ReportDB user accounts
