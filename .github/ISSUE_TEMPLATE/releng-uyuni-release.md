# Procedure

https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/wiki/Releasing-Uyuni-versions

# ToDo some days before

Add more tasks if needed.

- [ ] Check all the [tests](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Uyuni/): everything should be green, in particular the acceptance testsuite or otherwise submission must be approved by QA.
- [ ] Ask the Doc Squad to submit an update of the doc package to [systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master), a PR for the main documention and ReportDB documentation at the [documentation repository, gh-pages branch](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs/tree/gh-pages) and a PR for the [documentation API repository, gh-pages branch](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs-api/tree/gh-pages).
- [ ] Confirm that the documentation is ready.
- [ ] [Lock](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/settings/branch_protection_rules/2243617) the `master` branch (check the checkbox for `Restrict who can push to matching branches`)
- [ ] [Lock](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-tools/settings/branch_protection_rules/37702039) the `main` branch for the uyuni-tools as well (check the checkbox for `Restrict who can push to matching branches`)
- [ ] Send an email to galaxy-devel@suse.de informing that the branch `master` is locked, and adjust the topic on the slack [#team-susemanager](https://app.slack.com/client/T02863RC2AC/C02D78LLS04) channel
- [ ] After the branch freeze, ask [Orion](https://suse.slack.com/archives/C02DDMY6R0R) to prepare the PR for the code translations from `master-weblate` to `master`. If nobody from Orion is available, ask @parlt91. They will add us as reviewers.
- [ ] Merge the PR for the translations with the option `Merge pull request`
- [ ] Quick review changelogs with `tito-wrapper`, and request changes if needed
- [ ] Adjust the version number in `web/conf/rhn_web.conf` (`web.version.uyuni`)
- [ ] Check if the migration paths exist for both the main database and report database, if they are needed (more at https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/wiki/Releasing-Uyuni-versions)
- [ ] Check if schema migration directories exist last SUSE Manager versions and Uyuni (more at https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/wiki/Releasing-Uyuni-versions)
- [ ] Tag everything with `tito` and push
- [ ] Check that the job [uyuni-Master-releng-2obs](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Uyuni/job/uyuni-Master-releng-2obs/) job has packaged the whole tagging and submitted the changes from `master` branch into https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master (changes will propagate to the client tools for linked packages)
- [ ] Run `rel-eng/uyuni-check-version` at the Git repository, to check what other packages need changes and adjust them.
- [ ] Prepare the release notes PR, send it to be reviewed.
- [ ] Merge the release notes PR, submit the release notes to [systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master)
- [ ] Prepare the PR for the [website repository, master branch](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-project.github.io), including announcement at the main page, updates to the stable page, news page, new doc folder (PDFs) with doc and release notes.
- [ ] Prepare the email announcement and the twitter announcement, add them as comments to this card.
- [ ] Prepare a new [snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Snapshots) as `systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Snapshots:YYYY.MM`. You can use [systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Snapshots:2021.09](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Snapshots:2021.09) as base, but make sure you adjust the meta configuration to match the version and the expect Leap version used as base OS.
- [ ] Modify the [meta configuration](https://build.opensuse.org/projects/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable/meta) for `systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable`, so the promotion is done against the new Snapshot.
