Feature: Management of minion keys
  In Order to validate the minion onboarding page
  As an authorized user
  I want to verify all the minion key management features in the UI

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Delete SLES minion system profile before exploring the onboarding page
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Delete System"
    Then I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    When I click on "Delete Profile"
    And I wait until I see "has been deleted" text
    And I wait until Salt client is inactive on "sle_minion"
    Then "sle_minion" should not be registered

  Scenario: Completeness of the onboarding page
    When I follow the left menu "Salt > Keys"
    Then I should see a "Keys" text in the content area

  Scenario: Minion is visible in the Pending section
    When I configure salt minion on "sle_minion"
    And I restart salt-minion on "sle_minion"
    And I wait at most 10 seconds until Salt master sees "sle_minion" as "unaccepted"
    And I follow the left menu "Salt > Keys"
    And I refresh page until I see "sle_minion" hostname as text
    Then I should see a "Fingerprint" text
    And I see "sle_minion" fingerprint
    And I should see a "pending" text

  Scenario: Reject and delete the pending key
    And I follow the left menu "Salt > Keys"
    And I reject "sle_minion" from the Pending section
    And I wait at most 10 seconds until Salt master sees "sle_minion" as "rejected"
    Then I should see a "rejected" text
    # we stop the service so the minion does not resubmit its key spontaneously
    When I stop salt-minion on "sle_minion"
    And I delete "sle_minion" from the Rejected section
    And I refresh page until I do not see "sle_minion" hostname as text

  Scenario: Accepted minion shows up as a registered system
    When I start salt-minion on "sle_minion"
    And I wait at most 10 seconds until Salt master sees "sle_minion" as "unaccepted"
    Then "sle_minion" should not be registered
    When I follow the left menu "Salt > Keys"
    Then I should see a "pending" text
    When I accept "sle_minion" key
    And I wait at most 10 seconds until Salt master sees "sle_minion" as "accepted"
    And I wait until onboarding is completed for "sle_minion"
    Then "sle_minion" should be registered

  Scenario: The minion communicates with the Salt master
    Then the Salt master can reach "sle_minion"
    When I get OS information of "sle_minion" from the Master
    Then it should contain the OS of "sle_minion"

  Scenario: Delete profile of unreacheable minion
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I stop salt-minion on "sle_minion"
    And I follow "Delete System"
    Then I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    When I click on "Delete Profile"
    Then I wait until I see "Cleanup timed out. Please check if the machine is reachable." text
    When I click on "Delete Profile Without Cleanup" in "An error occurred during cleanup" modal
    And I wait until I see "has been deleted" text
    Then "sle_minion" should not be registered

  Scenario: Cleanup: bootstrap again the minion
    When I follow the left menu "Systems > Bootstrapping"
    Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
    When I enter the hostname of "sle_minion" as "hostname"
    And I enter "22" as "port"
    And I enter "root" as "user"
    And I enter "linux" as "password"
    And I select "1-SUSE-KEY-x86_64" from "activationKeys"
    And I select the hostname of "proxy" from "proxies" if present
    And I click on "Bootstrap"
    And I wait until I see "Successfully bootstrapped host!" text
    And I wait until onboarding is completed for "sle_minion"
