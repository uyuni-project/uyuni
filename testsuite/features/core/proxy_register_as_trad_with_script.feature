Feature: Setup Uyuni proxy
  In order to use a proxy with the Uyuni server
  As the system administrator
  I want to register the proxy to the server

  Scenario: Install proxy software
    When I refresh the metadata for "proxy"
    # uncomment when product is out:
    # When I install "SUSE-Manager-Proxy" product on the proxy
    And I install proxy pattern on the proxy
    And I let squid use avahi on the proxy

  Scenario: Create the bootstrap script for the proxy and use it
    When I execute mgr-bootstrap "--script=bootstrap-proxy.sh --no-up2date --traditional"
    Then I should get "* bootstrap script (written):"
    And I should get "    '/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-proxy.sh'"
    When I fetch "pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-proxy.sh" to "proxy"
    And I run "sh ./bootstrap-proxy.sh" on "proxy"

  Scenario: Copy the keys and configure the proxy
    When I copy server's keys to the proxy
    And I configure the proxy
    Then I should see "proxy" via spacecmd
    And service "salt-broker" is active on "proxy"

  Scenario: Log in as admin user
    Given I am authorized for the "Admin" section

@susemanager
  Scenario: Check proxy system details

    # TODO: uncomment when SCC product becomes available
    # When I wait until I see "SUSE Manager Proxy" text, refreshing the page
    Then I should see a "Proxy" link in the content area
