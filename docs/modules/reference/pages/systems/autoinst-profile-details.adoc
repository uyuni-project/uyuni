[[s4-system-ks-details-options]]
== Operating System

On this page, you can make the following changes to the operating system that the Kickstart profile installs:

Change the base channel::
Select from the available base channels. {productname} administrators see a list of all base channels that are currently synced to the {productname}.

Child Channels::
Subscribe to available child channels of the base channel, such as the Tools channel.

Available Trees::
Use the drop-down menu to choose from available trees associated with the base channel.

Always use the newest Tree for this base channel.::
Instead of selecting a specific tree, you can also check the box menu:Always use the newest Tree for this base channel.[]
This setting lets {productname} automatically pick the latest tree that is associated with the specified base channels.
If you add new trees later, {productname} will always keep the most recently created or modified.

Software URL (File Location)::
The exact location from which the Kickstart tree is mounted.
This value is determined when the profile is created.
You can view it on this page but you cannot change it.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-variables]]
== Variables

Autoinstallation variables can substitute values in Kickstart and {ay} profiles.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, if you want to autoinstall a system that joins the network of a specified organization (for example the Engineering department), you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the [guimenu]``Variables`` text box.

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----


Now you can use the name of the variable in the profile instead of a specific value.
For example, the [option]``network`` part of a Kickstart file looks like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----


The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be resolved to ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` to `192.168.0.1`

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in Kickstart files.
System Kickstart variables take precedence over [guimenu]``Profile`` variables, which in turn take precedence over [guimenu]``Distribution`` variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}s.
====


Using variables are just one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.
For more about Cobbler and templates, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-advanced]]
== Advanced Options

From this page, you can toggle several installation options on and off by checking and unchecking the boxes to the left of the option.
For most installations, the default options are correct.
Refer to Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation for details.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-defprofile]]
== Assigning Default Profiles to an Organization

You can specify an Organization Default Profile by clicking menu:Autoinstallation[Profiles > profile name > Details], then checking the [guimenu]``Organization Default Profile`` box and finally clicking [guimenu]``Update``.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-iprange]]
== Assigning IP Ranges to Profiles

You can associate an IP range to an autoinstallation profile by clicking on menu:Autoinstallation[Profiles > profile name > Bare Metal Autoinstallation], adding an IPv4 range and finally clicking menu:Add IP Range[].

[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-post]]
== Locale

Change the timezone for kickstarted systems.



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-partition]]
== Partitioning

From this subtab, indicate the partitions that you wish to create during installation.
For example:

----
partition /boot --fstype=ext3 --size=200
partition swap --size=2000
partition pv.01 --size=1000 --grow
volgroup myvg pv.01 logvol / --vgname=myvg --name=rootvol --size=1000 --grow
----



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-file-pres]]
== File Preservation

If you have previously created a file preservation list, include this list as part of the {kickstart}.
This will protect the listed files from being over-written during the installation process.
For more on file preservation lists, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-file-preservation.adoc[].



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-gpg-ssl]]
== GPG & SSL

From this subtab, select the GPG keys and/or SSL certificates to be exported to the kickstarted system during the %post section of the {kickstart}.
For {productname} customers, this list includes the SSL Certificate used during the installation of {productname}.

[NOTE]
====
Any GPG key you wish to export to the kickstarted system must be in ASCII rather than binary format.
====



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-trouble]]
== Troubleshooting

From this subtab, change information that may help with troubleshooting hardware problems:

Bootloader::
For some headless systems, it is better to select the non-graphic LILO bootloader.

Kernel Parameters::
Enter kernel parameters here that may help to narrow down the source of hardware issues.



[[s4-system-ks-soft-pkg-group]]
== Package Groups

image::details-ks-5.png[scaledwidth=444]

The image above shows subtabs that are available from the [guimenu]``Software`` tab.

Enter the package groups, such as [systemitem]``@office`` or [systemitem]``@admin-tools`` you would like to install on the kickstarted system in the large text box.
If you would like to know what package groups are available, and what packages they contain, refer to the [path]``RedHat/base/`` file of your Kickstart tree.




[[s4-system-ks-soft-pkg-profile]]
== Package Profiles

If you have previously created a Package Profile from one of your registered systems, you can use that profile as a template for the files to be installed on a kickstarted system.
For more about package profiles, see xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-packages.adoc#s1-package-profiles[].



[[s4-system-ks-act-keys]]
== Activation Keys

.Activation Keys

image::details-ks-6.png[scaledwidth=444]


The [guimenu]``Activation Keys`` tab allows you to select Activation Keys to include as part of the Kickstart profile.
These keys, which must be created before the Kickstart profile, will be used when re-registering kickstarted systems.




[[s4-system-ks-scripts]]
== Scripts

.Scripts
image::details-ks-7.png[scaledwidth=444]

The [guimenu]``Scripts`` tab is where [option]``%pre`` and [option]``%post`` scripts are created.
This page lists any scripts that have already been created for this Kickstart profile.
To create a Kickstart script, perform the following procedure:

. Click the [guimenu]``add new kickstart script`` link in the upper right corner.
. Enter the path to the scripting language used to create the script, such as ``/usr/bin/perl``.
. Enter the full script in the large text box.
. Indicate whether this script is to be executed in the [option]``%pre`` or [option]``%post`` section of the Kickstart process.
. Indicate whether this script is to run outside of the chroot environment. Refer to the [ref]_Post-installation Script_ section of the [ref]_Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Administration Guide_ for further explanation of the [option]``nochroot`` option.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} supports the inclusion of separate files within the Partition Details section of the Kickstart profile.
For instance, you may dynamically generate a partition file based on the machine type and number of disks at {kickstart} time.
This file can be created via [option]``%pre`` script and placed on the system, such as [path]``/tmp/part-include``.
Then you can call for that file by entering the following line in the Partition Details field of the menu:System Details[Partitioning] tab:

----
%include /tmp/part-include
----
====



[[s4-system-ks-ks-file]]
== Autoinstallation File

.Autoinstallation File
image::details-ks-8.png[scaledwidth=444]

The [guimenu]``Autoinstallation File`` tab allows you to view or download the profile that has been generated from the options chosen in the previous tabs.



[[ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles.upload]]
== Upload Kickstart/{ay} File

Click the [guimenu]``Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File`` link from the menu:Systems[Autoinstallation] page to upload an externally prepared {ay} or Kickstart profile.

. In the first line, enter a profile [guimenu]``Label`` for the automated installation. This label[] drop-down menu is only populated if one or more distributions have been created for the selected base channel (see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[]).
. Instead of selecting a specific tree, you can also check the box [guimenu]``Always use the newest Tree`` for this base channel. This setting lets {productname} automatically pick the latest tree that is associated with the specified base channels. If you add new trees later, {productname} will always keep the most recently created or modified.
. Select the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` from the drop-down menu. For more information about virtualization with **traditional clients**, see xref:client-configuration:virtualization.adoc[].

+
NOTE: If you do not intend to use the autoinstall profile to create virtual guest systems, you can leave the drop-down set to the default choice [guimenu]``KVM Virtualized Guest``.
+

. Either cut-and-paste the file contents, or update the file from the local storage medium:
** Paste it into the [guimenu]``File Contents`` box and click [guimenu]``Create``, or
** enter the file name in the [guimenu]``File to Upload`` field and click btn:[Upload File].

Four subtabs are now available:

* [guimenu]``Details``
