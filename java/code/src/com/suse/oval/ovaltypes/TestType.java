/**
 * The optional state_operator attribute provides the logical operator that combines the evaluation results from
 * each referenced state on a per item basis.  Each matching item is compared to each referenced state.
 * <p>
 * The result of comparing each state to a single item is combined based on the specified state_operator value to
 * determine one result for each item. Finally, the results for each item are combined based on the specified
 * check value.
 * <p>
 * Note that if the test does not contain any references to OVAL States, then the state_operator attribute has no
 * meaning and can be ignored during evaluation.
 * <p>
 * Referencing multiple states in one test allows ranges of possible values to be expressed. For example, one state
 * can check that a value greater than 8 is found and another state can check that a value of less than 16 is found.
 * In this example the referenced states are combined with a state_operator = 'AND' indicating that the conditions
 * of all referenced states must be satisfied and that the value must be between 8 AND 16.  The valid state_operation
 * values are explained in the description of the OperatorEnumeration simple type.
