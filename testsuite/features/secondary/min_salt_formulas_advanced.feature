Feature: Use advanced features of Salt formulas
  In order to use forms to apply changes to minions
  As an authorized user
  I want to be able to install and use Salt formulas

  Scenario: Install a test formula package on the server
     Given I am authorized
     When I install "form.yml" to custom formula metadata directory "testform"
     And I install "metadata.yml" to custom formula metadata directory "testform"
     When I follow the left menu "Salt > Formula Catalog"
     Then I should see a "testform" text

  Scenario: Assign test formula to minion via group formula
     Given I am on the groups page
     When I follow "Create Group"
     And I enter "test-formula-group" as "name"
     And I enter "Test group with testform formula added" as "description"
     And I click on "Create Group"
     Then I should see a "System group test-formula-group created." text
     When I follow "Formulas" in the content area
     Then I should see a "Choose formulas:" text
     And I should see a "General System Configuration" text
     And I should see a "Testform" text
     When I check the "testform" formula
     And I click on "Save"
     And I follow "Target Systems"
     And I check the "sle_minion" client
     And I click on "Add Systems"
     Then I should see a "1 systems were added to test-formula-group server group." text
