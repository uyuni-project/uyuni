/**
 * EusReleaseComparator
 *
 * Compare two RHEL releases, where the behavior can differ depending on which version
 * of RHEL we're dealing with. (RHEL 4 in particular needs special attention.)
 *
 * "Release" in this context ends up appearing more like what we'd call a version,
 * i.e. 5.3.0.3. Thus a simple string comparison will not suffice. (5.10 > 5.9)
 *
 * Additionally, for all versions of RHEL, we may need to trim pieces of the version
 * off to do the comparison.
 *
 * Sample releases:
 *   RHEL 4: 7.6, 8, 9
 *   RHEL 5: 5.1.0.1, 5.2.0.2, 5.3.0.3
