tests that are not relevant in SUSE Manager:
com/redhat/rhn/frontend/xmlrpc/test/SatScrubberTest.class

temporarily disabled tests (do not run in IBM Java):
com/suse/scc/client/test/SCCClientUtilTest.class

this triggers a known Hibernate bug when running without c3p0
we should re-enable this when we upgrade Hibernate past 3.2.4
com/redhat/rhn/webapp/test/RhnServletListenerTest.class

upstream is fixing this
com/redhat/rhn/frontend/nav/test/NavNodeTest.class
