 * ListFilter
 * ListFilters provide custom filtration logic for performing filtering on DataResult
 * lists. By default, ListControl filters all results that do not match the filter
 * data. While this is typically all the filtering needed, there are cases in which
 * we need to preserve results that would normally be filtered out. An example
 * would be a DataResult in which results have a parent/child relationship. We may
 * wish to preserve the parent of any child not filtered out. ListFilter allows
 * us to define such custom logic as necessary.
