"""
Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications;
controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.
Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as
ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts
for duplicating software package installations on different servers.
It can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of
Don Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like
modules for Python require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to
be compiled. Pexpect does not use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It
should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty
module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so that simple
tasks are easy.

Pexpect is Open Source, Free, and all Good that stuff.

        The pattern can be a StringType, EOF, a compiled re, or
        a list of those types. Strings will be compiled to re types.
        This returns the index into the pattern list. If the pattern was
        not a list this returns index 0 on a successful match.
        This may raise exceptions for EOF or TIMEOUT.
        To avoid the EOF or TIMEOUT exceptions add EOF or TIMEOUT to

        'before', 'after' and 'match' will be set.
        You can see all the data read before the match in 'before'.
        You can see the data that was matched in 'after'.
        The re.MatchObject used in the re match will be in 'match'.
        If an error occurred then 'before' will be set to all the
        data read so far and 'after' and 'match' will be None.

        If timeout is -1 then timeout will be set to the self.timeout value.

        Note: A list entry may be EOF or TIMEOUT instead of a string.
        This will catch these exceptions and return the index
        of the list entry instead of raising the exception.
        The attribute 'after' will be set to the exception type.
        The attribute 'match' will be None.
        This allows you to write code like this:
                index = p.expect (['good', 'bad', pexpect.EOF, pexpect.TIMEOUT])
                if index == 0:

        instead of code like this:

                    if index == 0:

### Weird bug. If you read too fast after doing a sendline()
# Sometimes you will read the data back that you just sent even if
# the child did not echo the data. This is particularly a problem if
# you send a password.

# This was previously used to implement a look-ahead in reads.
# if the lookahead failed then Pexpect would "push-back" the data
# that was read. The idea was to allow read() to read blocks of data.
# What I do now is just read one character at a time and then try a
# match. This is not as efficient, but it works well enough for the
# output of most applications and it makes program logic much simpler.
