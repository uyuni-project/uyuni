Feature: Test a reboot on a traditional-client

  Scenario: Reboot a tradional client (sle)
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this client
    When I follow first "Schedule System Reboot"
    Then I should see a "System Reboot Confirmation" text
    And I should see a "Reboot system" button
    And I click on "Reboot system"
    And I run rhn_check on this client
    Then I wait and check that "sle-client" has rebooted
