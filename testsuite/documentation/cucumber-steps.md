### Basic notions

We use "targets" in the Ruby code to encapsulate the notion of testing hosts.
The corresponding notion in Cucumber steps is "step host names".

Possible values are currently:

| Test host | Ruby target |  Bash environment variable | Step host name | Sumaform module |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| SUSE Manager server | ```$server``` | ```$SERVER``` |  | ```"suse_manager"``` |
| SUSE Manager proxy | ```$proxy``` | ```$PROXY``` | ```"proxy"``` | ```"suse_manager_proxy"``` |
| SLES traditional client | ```$client``` | ```$CLIENT``` | ```"sle_client"``` or ```"sle_ssh_tunnel_client"```| ```"client"``` |
| SLES Salt minion | ```$minion``` | ```$MINION``` | ```"sle_minion"``` or ```"sle_migrated_minion"``` or ```"sle_ssh_tunnel_minion"```| ```"minion"``` |
| SLES Docker and Kiwi build host | ```$build_host``` | ```$BUILD_HOST``` | ```"build_host"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| SLES Salt SSH minion | ```$ssh_minion``` | ```$SSHMINION``` | ```"ssh_minion"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| CentOS Salt minion or traditional client | ```$ceos_minion``` | ```$CENTOSMINION``` | ```"ceos_minion"```, ```"ceos_traditional_client"```, or ```"ceos_ssh_minion"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| Ubuntu minion | ```$ubuntu_minion``` | ```$UBUNTUMINION``` | ```"ubuntu_minion"``` or ```"ubuntu_ssh_minion"``` | ```"minion"``` |
| PXE-Boot minion |  None | ```$PXEBOOT_MAC``` | ```"pxeboot_minion"``` | ```"pxeboot"``` |
| KVM virtual host minion | ```$kvm_server``` | ```$VIRTHOST_KVM_URL``` and ```$VIRTHOST_KVM_PASSWORD``` | ```"kvm_server"``` | ```"virthost"``` |
| Xen virtual host minion | ```$xen_server``` | ```$VIRTHOST_XEN_URL``` and ```$VIRTHOST_XEN_PASSWORD``` | ```"xen_server"``` | ```"virthost"``` |

These names are such for historical reasons and might be made better in the future.

### Reusing old steps

These are only the most important generic steps. For more specialized steps,
please grep in the source code.


<a name="b1" />

#### Logging in and out

* Go to the login page

```cucumber
  When I go to the home page
```

* Sign in as user "testing" with password "testing"

```cucumber
  Given I am authorized
```

* Sign in as a given user with given password

```cucumber
  Given I am authorized as "admin" with password "admin"
```

* Check we are signed in

```cucumber
  Then I should be logged in
```

To check for the initial log in, prefer ```Then I am logged in```.

* Sign out

```cucumber
  Given I sign out
```

* Check we are signed out

```cucumber
  Then I should not be authorized
```


<a name="b2" />

#### Navigating through pages

* Go to a given page through a the left menu tree with the complete menu path

<a name="b3" />

#### Texts

* Check for a given text

```cucumber
  Then I should see a "System Overview" text
  Then I should not see a "[Management]" text
  Then I should see a "Keys" text in the content area
  Then I should see "sle_minion" hostname
  Then I should not see "sle_minion" hostname
  Then table row for "test-net1" should contain "running"
```

For a test with a regular expression, there is ```I should see a text like "..."```

* Same, but wait until text appears

```cucumber
  When I wait until I see "Successfully bootstrapped host!" text
  When I wait until I do not see "Loading..." text
  When I wait at most 360 seconds until I see "Product Description" text
  When I wait until the tree item "test-pool0" contains "inactive" text
  When I wait until table row for "test-net1" contains "running"
```

* Same, but re-issue HTTP requests to refresh the page

```cucumber
  When I wait until I see "Software Updates Available" text, refreshing the page
  When I wait until I do not see "Apply highstate scheduled by admin" text, refreshing the page
  When I wait until I see the name of "sle_minion", refreshing the page
  When I wait until I do not see the name of "sle_minion", refreshing the page
  When I wait until the table contains "FINISHED" or "SKIPPED" followed by "FINISHED" in its first rows
  When I refresh page until I see "sle_minion" hostname as text
```

(last one should probably be renamed - it looks in the contents area of the page)

The button can be identified by id, value, title, text content, or alt of image.
If several buttons have been found, this step picks the first one.

* Click on a given radio button

```cucumber
  When I check radio button "schedule-by-action-chain"
  When I choose ";"
```

The radio button can be identified by name, id or label text.

(will be unified)

```

* Click on a given check box

```cucumber
  When I check "manageWithSSH"
  When I uncheck "role_org_admin"
  When I check "container_build_host" if not checked
```

The check box can be identified by name, id or label text.

```cucumber
  When I check the row with the "virgo-dummy-3456" link
  When I check the row with the "sle_client" hostname
  When I check the row with the "suse_docker_admin" text
  When I check "New Test Channel" in the list
  When I uncheck "hoag-dummy-1.1-1.1" in the list
```

(will be unified)

* Make sure a checkbox is checked or not

```cucumber
  Then I should see "metadataSigned" as checked
  Then I should see "role_org_admin" as unchecked
```

* Select an item from a selection box

```cucumber
  When I select "Mr." from "prefix"
  When I select the hostname of "proxy" from "proxies"
```

```cucumber
  Then option "Mr." is selected as "prefix"
```

* Check for a button in a given row

```cucumber
  When I wait until table row for "test-vm" contains button "Resume"
  When I wait at most 300 seconds until table row for "test-vm" contains button "Resume"
  When I wait until the tree item "test-pool1" contains "test-pool1 is started automatically" button
```

  When I enter the hostname of "proxy" as "hostname"
  When I enter "SUSE Test Key x86_64" as "description" text area
```

Note that the text area variant handles the new lines characters while the others don't.

* Calling various XML-RPC methods

For example:

```cucumber
  When I call actionchain.add_package_install()
```


<a name="b13" />

#### Virtualization

* Create a test virtual machine on a given host

The virtual machine is created without SUSE Manager, directly on the virtual host
using `qemu-img` and `virt-install`

```cucumber
  When I create "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server"
  When I create empty "/path/to/disk.qcow2" qcow2 disk file on "virt-server"
```

* Checking the state of a virtual machine

```cucumber
  Then I should see "test-vm" virtual machine shut off on "virt-server"
  Then I should see "test-vm" virtual machine running on "virt-server"
  Then I should see "test-vm" virtual machine paused on "virt-server"
  Then I should not see a "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server"
```

The previous steps are just checking the virtual machine state in libvirt.
To make sure the virtual machine is completely booted:

```cucumber
  When I wait until virtual machine "test-vm" on "virt-server" is started
```

* Check the definition of a virtual machine

```cucumber
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have 1024MB memory and 2 vcpus
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have spice graphics device
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have 2 NIC using "default" network
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have a NIC with 02:34:56:78:9a:bc MAC address
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have a "disk.qcow2" scsi disk
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have a virtio cdrom
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have no cdrom
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have a "myvolume" virtio disk from pool "test-pool"
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should have "/path/to/image.iso" attached to a cdrom
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should boot using autoyast
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should boot on hard disk at next start
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should stop on reboot
Then "test-vm" virtual machine on "virt-server" should not stop on reboot at next start
```

* Remove disk images from a storage pool

```cucumber
When I delete all "test-vm.*" volumes from "default" pool on "kvm_server" without error control
```

* Add or remove virtual network or storage pools

```cucumber
When I create test-net1 virtual network on "kvm_server"
When I create test-pool1 virtual storage pool on "kvm_server"
When I delete test-net1 virtual network on "kvm_server"
When I delete test-pool1 virtual storage pool on "kvm_server"
```

* Managing storage pools

```cucumber
When I refresh the "test-pool0" storage pool of this "kvm-server"
```

* Managing virtual networks

```cucumber
When I should not see a "test-net1" virtual network on "kvm-server"
```

### Writing new steps

Here we describe only the specificities of this testsuite. For a description
of the underlying libraries, have a look at
[Capybara documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara).

#### Running remote commands

When implementing a step, to run a command on a target, use:

```ruby
$server.run("uptime")
$client.run("uptime", false)
$minion.run("uptime", true)
$minion.run("uptime", true, 300)
$client.run("uptime", false, 500, "root")
```

Arguments taken by method ```run``` are:

1. command to execute on the target system.
2. true/false, by **default** is ```true```. If the return code of the command is nonzero, then we raise an error and make the test fail. Sometimes, we expect that a command fails, or sometimes, it is not relevant whether it succeeded, so we use ```false``` in such cases.
3. timeout : **default** is 200. You can increase/decrease the timeout. You may want to use a smaller timeout, but retry several times until ```DEFAULT_TIMEOUT```.
4. user : **default** is root. It's the user that executes the command.

#### Getting the FQDN of a host

When implementing a step, to get the FQDN of the host, use:

```ruby
  STDOUT.puts $client.full_hostname
```

#### Converting between host name and target

When implementing a step, to convert a step host name into a target, use:

```ruby
  node = get_target(target)
```

#### Using cookies to store login information

It is possible to work with cookies in testsuite and use them to store login information. There are no special dependencies except `Marshal` module for Ruby.

Following code is expected to be a part of function used as step definition for user authorization:

```ruby
  # Check if there is already stored cookie session. If that is true, use it to login.
  cookie_path = '/tmp/web-session'
  if File.file?(cookie_path)
    # Load of serialized cookie data from file in binary mode
    cookie_data = Marshal.load(File.open(cookie_path, 'rb'))
    cookie_data.each do |cookie|
      page.driver.browser.manage.add_cookie(cookie)
    end
    # Reload page for login to take an effect
    page.evaluate_script 'window.location.reload()'
    # End function call if user is logged in
    next if page.all(:xpath, "//header//span[text()='#{user}']").any?
  end
  # This code is executed only in case session is not stored yet.
  cookie = page.driver.browser.manage.all_cookies
  # Serialization and save of cookies to file in binary mode
  File.open(cookie_path, 'wb') { |cookie_file|
    Marshal.dump(cookie, cookie_file)
  }
```

NOTE: This solution was tested and worked properly, but there was no time gain in comparison with old solution using capybara steps.
